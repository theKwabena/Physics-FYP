A much faster pace compared
to previous incubation period of 24 hours.

in regards to containment.

00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:01,603
has led the infected
to display animal-like behaviors,

12
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:04,898
making it difficult
to secure quarantine facilities.

13
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:09,652
In the United States, more than
150,000 people have been infected,

"Backtrace"?

301
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,537
[woman] There's a car approaching

Get in the car and hand over the device.

303
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,875
Tell me why the CIA is chasing me.

304
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,127
[woman] There's a lethal bomb
planted in your mouth.

305
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,630
It has blast radius of ten meters.

306
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,886
If you refuse to work with us,
it will activate.

License plate 4566.

308
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,099
Your questions will be answered
once you get into the car.

309
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,185
And why would I get in that car?

310
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,228
Tell me, now.

311
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,396
[woman] Then you give us no choice.

312
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,315
You must be terminated.

313
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,819
I have the detonator here in my hand.

00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,074
[Carter panting]

315
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,495

Move it. And hurry.

00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,757

-Hack it.
-Right. I'll start tracing them.

325
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,833
Choi Yu-jin, NIS.
Strategic relations with North Korea.

326
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,629
And the woman talking in my ear,
she on your side?

327
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,880
I'm Han Jung Hee.

328
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,757
I work for
the International Liaison Department

329
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,259
of the Labor Party in North Korea.

330
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:46,471
We are currently working with South Korea
to create a treatment for the DMZ Virus.

331
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:53,270
[Yu-jin] These are North Koreans
who have been infected by the DMZ Virus.

332
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,356
The infected
are overwhelmingly strong and violent.

333
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,985
Some have been discovered
to even be able to use tools or weapons.

334
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:03,947
All of South Korea's army is at the DMZ,
holding off the infected,

335
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,991
but every day is precarious.

336
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,660
[Jung Hee] In North Korea, we have secured

337
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,747
a hundred million anthrax vaccines
needed to produce the treatment,

338
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,790
as well as a large scale assembly line,

339
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,960
so that Dr. Jung's research
can be carried out smoothly.

340
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,879
That's the reason we tried to bring

341
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,589
Dr. Jung and his daughter, Jung Ha-na,

342
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,008
to the North
for the completion of the project.

343
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,510
Daughter?

344
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,346
Dr. Jung's daughter was infected

345
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,931
by a field rat
while they were living out in Paju.

346
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,184
He was able to cure his own daughter,

347
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:35,187
and started studying her antibodies
to find a treatment.

348
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,901
However, due to an abnormal increase
in thromboplastin,

349
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,612
an enzyme that coagulates blood
once it leaves the body,

350
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,655
her antibodies were destroyed in seconds.

351
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,533
That's why we were heading to
the Sinuiju Chemical Weapons Institute,

352
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,785
for Ha-na's blood.

353
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,371
[Jung Hee] However, Ha-na was kidnapped
on her way to North Korea

354
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,624
by an agent from A9,
a secret organization in the CIA,.

355
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,668
Your mission is to find Ha-na
and bring her to North Korea.

356
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,879
You're the one who suggested this mission.

357
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:01,963
It was your idea.

358
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,424
Why would I?

359
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,803
[Jung Hee] You commanded us
to block the memory center in your brain.

360
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,221
Am I your commander?

361
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,264
[Jung Hee] I suppose you'll return
to your position

362
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,766
after the mission is finished.

363
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:17,813
Why would I erase my memory,
and give up my rank?

364
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,440
[Jung Hee] You used to be
a CIA agent from South Korea,

365
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,568
but you disguised yourself as a reporter
and entered North Korea.

366
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,489
You became a hero to our people.
You were a hero to South Korea.

367
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:32,119
However, the North Korean government was
suspicious that you were an American spy

368
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,871
and assigned a woman
to keep a close eye on you.

369
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,625
The two of you fell in love,
and even got married.

370
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,836
And then, you had a daughter.

371
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,505
This woman and I?

372
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,299
[Yu-jin] But your wife died
from the DMZ Virus,

373
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,635
and your daughter, Yoon Hee,
also got infected

374
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,847
and is now imprisoned
in the research facility in Sinuiju.

375
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:53,974
[beeps]

376
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,853
[Carter on video] This is a good shot.

377
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,688
Look over here.

378
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,440
Yoon Hee.

379
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,525
[somber music playing]

380
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:11,491
Yoon Hee!

381
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,662
[Yoon Hee] Dad? Dad?

382
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,165
Dad… [sobbing]

383
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,667
-[sobbing] …Dad.
-[Carter] Yoon Hee.

384
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,462
[Yoon Hee sobbing]

385
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,048
[Jung Hee] That scar
on the back of your hand

386
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,301
is from the burn that you got that night.

387
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,972
The weapons you need
for the infiltration are in here.

388
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:38,101
Now you can do what Han Jung Hee says
until the assignment is complete.

389
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,853
[Jung Hee] You need to save Ha-na

390
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,022
so that your daughter,

391
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,523
Lee Yun Hui, might live.

392
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,609
-[engine revving]
-[tires screeching]

393
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,488
[contemplative music playing]

394
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,700
[Jung Hee] Go to the rooftop.

395
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,078
Ha-na is being held in the building
across from this one.

396
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,164
[music continues]

397
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,584
[tires screeching]

398
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,797
Check the weapons in the bag
and put them on.

399
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,511
[unzipping]

400
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:22,187
We must move Ha-na today
if we want to save your daughter's life.

401
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,565
She doesn't have much time left.

402
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,611
The majority of those infected
die just under 13 days.

403
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,990
Today is the 13th day
since your daughter was infected.

404
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:43,124
How do I know
that child is really my daughter?

405
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,876
[Jung Hee] When you get your memory back,

406
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,670
and your daughter is dead,

407
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,339
who will you blame?

408
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,094
[action music playing]

409
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,225
[panting]

410
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,739
Go through the door to your right
and move to the edge of the rooftop.

411
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,706
I've hacked the communication channels
of the CIA agents in the building.

412
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,499
I'm getting their whereabouts now.

413
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,835
[agent 1 on radio] Negative, sir.

414
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,546
We're still working on
establishing the identity of the subject.

415
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,174
[agent 2] Bullshit! Get the geeks
at Langley on it if you have to.

416
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,092
I can't do shit

417
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,886
until we have actual evidence
that the North is on the move.

418
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:41,016
[Jung Hee] The agents are gathered in
the motel you were in. Now is the chance.

419
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,101
[tense music playing]

420
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,612
[grunts]

421
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,912
[whizzing]

422
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,374
[whirring]

423
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,172
FLORAL SUPPLIES WHOLESALE MARKET

424
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,511
[grunts, pants]

425
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,389
[Jung Hee] The elevator control room is
through the door in front of you.

426
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,807
Move toward it.

427
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,893
[action music continues]

428
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,781
I'm detecting the heat signature
of one adult

429
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:41,368
near the elevator on the ninth floor
and two on the seventh floor.

430
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,036
This mall looks out of business.

431
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,997
[Jung Hee] It's the perfect place
for the CIA to set up a temporary base.

432
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,209
The agents that were sent to the motel
are on their way back. Hurry.

433
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,585
And Ha-na?

434
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,587
[Jung Hee] I'm detecting
the heat signature.

435
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,048
I'm detecting her on the sixth floor.

436
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,265
[action music continues]

437
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:07,977

[Carter grunts]

442
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:26,079
[Jung Hee] Ha-na will be in the playroom
once you go through the emergency exit.

443
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,081
The heat signatures
near the entrance are targets.

444
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,457
EMERGENCY EXIT

445

[suspenseful music playing]

448
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,776
Who are you? Why are you here?

449
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:01,406
Stay back! Stay away from me!

450
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:05,285
[Carter] Ha-na? You're Ha-na, right?

451
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,203
-Listen, I'm--
-Stay back I said!

452
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,289
[panting]

453
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,671
What should I do?

454
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,423
[Jung Hee] Hand her the phone.

455
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,508
[Carter panting]

456
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,020
Here, answer it.

457
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,190
I'll stay over here. Hmm?

458
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,776
[phone buzzing]

459
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,122
Um, hello?

460
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,751
Dad? Dad, please, where are you?

461
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:58,963
Yeah.

462
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:01,800
Yeah.

463
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,093
Okay.

464
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,559
Dad, can I trust this man?

465
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:14,771
Okay.

466
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,274
Okay, I'll do that.

467
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,194
Okay.

468
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,697
[phone beeps]

469
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,330
Are you all right?

470
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,458
-Yes.
-Let's go find your dad.

471
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,170
How though? How do we get out of here?

472
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,256
[suspenseful music playing]

473
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,345

[tense music playing]

483
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,412
You are a hard man to find, Mr. Lee.

484
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,333
Carter Lee.

485
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,503
That is your name, isn't it?

486
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,509
Oh, we're playing that game now.

487
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,636
That's fine.

488
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,182
Fortunately for us, I have a shit-ton
of computer geeks back at Langley

489
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:59,769
who get a boner whenever I ask
them to dig up some shit on people.

490
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,312
[chuckles]

491
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,605
Between you and me,

492
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:06,109
they're probably a bunch
of introverted perverts who

493
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,320
couldn't do four push-ups
to save their life. But, uh,

494
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,156
they get the job done. So, you know,

495
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,283
what are you gonna to do?

496
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,956
All right, let's see here.

497
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:26,045
"Carter Lee. Born in 1986.
Jamsil, South Korea."

498
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,590
"Immigrated to New York at age 11."

499
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,468
Blah, blah, blah.

500
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,804
Some more boring shit.

501
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,682
Oh, damn!

502
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,476
You went to Sornell?

503
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,770
My cousin went there!

504
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,064
Yeah! [chuckles]

505
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,691
He was a real piece of shit.

506
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:47,859
[chuckles softly]

507
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,153
Oh, okay, here we go.

508
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:55,283
2014, you traveled to North Korea
as a journalist and, uh…

509
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,160
What?

510
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:01,164
You become
a naturalized citizen of the DPRK?

511
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,208
[gasps] Oh!

512
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,794
I bet it was
all of that socialist bullshit

513
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,796
they taught you back at Sornell.

514
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,548
Am I right? Huh?

515
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,843
A real hero of the people.

516
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:14,761
Yeah.

517
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,473
[inhales deeply] So,
here's the thing I don't understand,

518
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,184
and, uh, maybe you can help me out this.

519
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:26,647
What the fuck
are you doing back in South Korea?

520
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,941
And more importantly,

521
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:33,571
why are you fucking up my shit?

522
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,656
[light flickering]

523
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,411
All right. [chuckles, inhales]

524
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,039
So check this out, man. I…

525
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,168
I actually don't give a fuck about you.
I-- I really don't.

526
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,838
Just tell me who you're working for.

527
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,342
And, uh… we'll call it a day.

528
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:55,885
Huh?

529
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,262
Is it the North?

530
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,432
Is it the South?

531
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,395
Come on. You can tell Smith Hyeong.

532
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:12,193
The North or the South.
What does it matter?

533
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,987
[Smith] Oh, shit.

534
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,532
[laughing] You can talk!

535
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,159
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please, continue.

536
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,622
At least they aren't the ones
watching people die from the virus.

537
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,707
And treating it as an opportunity.

538
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,294
[Smith] So you're saying
the United States…

539
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:35,174
You think those 300,000
pissed off Koreans out there,

540
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,634
feel the same way?

541
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,470
I don't know,
I think they're pretty convinced

542
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:43,599
that this is all a fabricated scheme
formed by the South Korean government!

543
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,725
"Fabricated"?

544
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,895
Didn't you create that rumor
to incite a riot?

545
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:49,605
"Rumor"?

546
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,233
[scoffs] Us?

547
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,278
[laughs]

548
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,739
[inhales deeply] Oh, wow.

549
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,117
Carter.

550
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,829
The things they led you to believe…

551
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,791
Have you ever considered the possibility

552
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,043
that it could be

553
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,130
even more blinding

554
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:15,882
of the truth?

555
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,842
The real truth?

556
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,428
[agent] Sir!

557
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,431
What is it?

558
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,558
The CCTV results came in.

559
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:29,270
The movement of Carter Lee matches
that of former CIA Agent Michael Bane

560
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,813
by 87%.

561
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,274
Michael Bane…

562
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,237
Wasn't he KIA in Syria
in your last deployment together?

563
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:39,989
Yes, sir.

564
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:41,908
They told us he was dead,

565
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,452
but none of us had
actual eyes on his remains.

566
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,874
[suspenseful music playing]

567
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,929
[groans] The fuck are you doing?

568
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,890
BD-7…

569
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,560
That's how
they successfully wiped his memory.

570
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,313
Maybe.

571
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:17,193
But I don't think they fully reconstructed
the new one quite yet.

572
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,446
The eyes…

573
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,241
You can change the face,

574
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,451
but not the eyes.

575
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,496
And they never lie.

576
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,794
Is this why you rushed back to Korea?

577
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,050
We'll have the answers
once we've run the DNA lab, sir.

578
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,095
[inhales deeply]

579
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,305
The commies are getting cute. [sighs]

580
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,516
Run it.

581
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,184
Sir.

582
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,605
What the hell's going on?

583
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,857
Hang tight, hero.

584
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,609
Who knows?

585
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:03,698
Maybe the results will tell me
that you're not as useless as I thought.

586
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,034
[agent 2 on radio] Sir! There's a signal
coming from the subject's body.

587
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,120
Scan it.

588
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,997
[Jung Hee] Carter!
I need to cut communication

589
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,373
from your ear piece for a moment

590
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,250
and use the signal in your molar
as a decoy.

591
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,335
[device whirring]

592
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,673
Picking up a strange signal
coming from his molar, sir.

593
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,884
What the fuck are you waiting on?
Take it out!

594
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,638
[grunts] Get off me! Get off!

595
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,556

[groans]

599
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,065

Are you okay?

Yes, I'm okay.

626
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,387

[demonstrators] Repatriate! Repatriate!

670
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,333
Well, it's because
they want you to stay safe.

[thunder rumbling]

677
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,815
[newscaster] We bring you breaking news.

678
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,318
Dr. Jung, who had been missing until now,

679
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,904
has been confirmed to be in Sinuiju.

680
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:20,491
We've just received a video
showing Dr. Jung himself.

681
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,701
Let us take a look.

682
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,789
[Dr. Jung] Hello. I am Jung Byeong-ho.

683
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:30,125
And I have arrived safely to Sinuiju,

684
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,379
thanks to the North
and South Korean governments.

685
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:37,007
I have also spoken to my daughter
on the phone moments ago

686
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:40,803
and I plan to start developing a cure
as soon as possible…

687
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,471
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH JUNG BYEONG-HO

688
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:45,182
once I make it to
the Sinuiju Institute as planned.

689
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:49,687
Also, I have heard rumors
that the South Korean government

690
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,690
is attempting to destroy the North
right now.

691
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,402
However, I assure you it is not true.

692
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,029
Please do not be misled.

693
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,200
[newscaster] That was a video of Dr. Jung
sent directly from Sinuiju.

694
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:07,413
We will be reporting the rest
on our regular scheduled news. Thank you.

-No! He can't.
-What?

701
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,880
-You're terrible at writing songs.
-Yeah, I can't. [laughs]

702
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:58,797
Wait, try again…

703
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,300
[Jung Hee] Carter, why did you stop?

704
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,386
Ha-na is a little tired.

705
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,721
-I'm fine--
-Shh.

706
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:09,183
[Jung Hee] The van is approaching
across the street. Hurry.

711
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:08,700
[Yu-jin] What?

712
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,912
Carter is heading towards the bus
with Ha-na!

713
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,581
[Jung Hee] Carter. Where are you going?

714
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,708
Follow my instructions.

715
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,419
I'm detecting the movements
of CIA agents nearby.

716
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,506
Carter! Why are you getting on a bus
all of a sudden?

717
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,843
Get off the bus!
Listen to my instructions. Carter!

718
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,846
I think the CIA has caught on to your van.

719
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,807
[Jung Hee] If you don't follow my orders,
you and your daughter will both-

720
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,977
-[electronic warble and whine]
-[groans]

721

[panting]

723
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:43,277
I've blocked the signal
to the device in your ear, Mich…

724
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,403
Agent Bane.

725
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,613
Why are you calling me Michael Bane?

726
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,157
It's time you tell me who you really are.

727
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:52,119
Someone who knows you better
than that voice in your ear.

728
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,038
Yeah? What makes you so sure?

729
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,207
[exhales sharply]

730
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:02,963
There was a time
where we faced life and death, together.

731
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,467
I'm on your side, Mike. I always was.

732
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,678
My side?

733
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,723
Your men just tried to kill me back there.

734
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,894
And you expect me
to believe that you're on my side?

735
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,856
You really don't remember us?

736
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,109
[scoffs]

737
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,485
I still see you…

738
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,239
In your eyes, I…

739
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,200
I just know you're still there.

740
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,246
I just know it's you.

741
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,707
[breathes deeply]

742
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,418
[scoffs] Never mind.

743
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,753
[sniffles]

744
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,130
It doesn't matter
if you remember me or not.

745
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,424
The DNA test will prove
that you're Michael Bane.

746
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:51,094
And until then,
our agency will continue to hunt you down.

747
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,306
You have to trust me
if you want to survive.

748
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,433
Yeah?

749
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,353
I've been hearing that a lot lately.

750
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,607
Fine. It's time you know
who they really are.

751
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:07,235
[man on earpiece] What's going on?
You still can't get a signal to Carter?

752
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,488
[Jung Hee] Someone's blocking
the communications channel.

753
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,865
First, let me identify the woman
who approached Carter.

754
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,951
[man 2] The South is manipulating
the traffic lights.

755
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,078
The bus will stop 50 meters ahead
for one minute.

756
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,789
-Then we will be in range for the shot.
-[man] Take her down.

757
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:21,833
[Jung Hee] We can identify her first,
there'll be time to take her out after.

758
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,043
[man] Fire!

759

That's Michael Bane!

[agent] It doesn't matter who he is.
He's gone rogue.

Yes, that way,
the entire world will be watching us.

from acting so reckless.

gave no statement

regarding the kidnapping itself,

882

merely making a statement that reuniting
the doctor with his daughter

883
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:13,174
is of the utmost priority.

We will keep you updated
on further developments in this story,

885
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:19,639

in Ha-na's safe return to North Korea.

[Director Kim] Hey now,
you shouldn't smoke with a child on board.

887
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,775
[official] Hey, look,
there's no need to be so uptight.

888
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:32,110
[laughs]

889
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:36,406
[inhales deeply] You will be staying here
as we make our way to North Korea.

890
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,741
Here, this way.

891
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:42,370
[tense music playing]

892
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,790
Hey, you gotta be Ha-na.

893
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,126
Ha-na.

894
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,510
Come on, all right?

895
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,223
To start, you should both see our medic.

896
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,766
TREATMENT ROOM

897
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:08,187
Hello. Welcome.

898
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:18,239
If you'll remove that,
we can start the treatment.

899
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:25,413
You can take that seat.
The plane is taking off soon.

900
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,382
[reporter] Excuse me,
we have an interview.

901
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,052
-[agent] After the treatment.
-Well, we'll do the interview later.

902
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,345
[Director Kim] Sorry, later.

903
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:46,100
You both can change
once your injuries are mended.

904
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,644
Okay. Disinfect it.

905
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:53,566
Don't worry. It won't hurt anymore, okay?

906
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:00,907
Mister, are you okay?

907
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:03,868
I'm okay.

908
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,245
Are you okay?

909
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,122
I'm okay too.

910
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:09,666
[Carter] Hmm.

911
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,089
Why is your hand like that?

912
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,721
I can't remember.

913
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,308
I think I was with my daughter.

914
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,146
Well, um, aren't you remembering now?

915
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,401
When I see this scar on my hand,

916
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,529
it's as if I can hear a child crying.

917
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,284
Though, she might not
make it through today.

918
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:48,204
My daughter, that is.

919
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:52,291
What's your daughter's name?

920
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:55,920
Yoon Hee.

921
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,214
"Yoon Hee."

922
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:02,093
But I'm here, so it'll work out.

923
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:06,264
I'm the cure, right? A human cure.

924
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:08,975
[laughs]

925
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,686
[man] All right, the treatment is done.

926
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,021
Excellent. Thank you.

927
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:17,442
All right. Why don't you put these on?

928
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:24,866
Ha-na, you should get changed as well,

929
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:27,034
after Mr. Carter is done. [chuckles]

930
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,873
Once you arrive in North Korea,
your mission will be finished.

931
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:35,042
I sincerely hope
that the cure is completed in time,

932
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,587
so that your child can be saved.

933
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:41,549
Was this mission really my choice?

934
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,510
So that I could save my daughter?

935
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,596
[Director Kim] You'll get an answer
to that question

936
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,347
once your mission is complete.

937
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,516
Until then, don't let down your guard.

938
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:52,351
Remember this.

939
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:57,774
there may even be individuals
on this plane who are after Ha-na.

940
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:01,402
[Carter] Didn't you say
that the US can't interfere anymore?

941
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,696
[Jung Hee] We have reason to believe

942
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,158
that the CIA may have ordered
other forces to move in on Ha-na.

943
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:11,245
It's possible North-Korean personnel
may be involved, wanting to start a coup.

944
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:15,082
[Carter sighs] The CIA contacting
the spy organization makes sense,

945
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,002
but what do you mean
by a coup within North Korea?

946
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:22,632
Well, we suspect
the virus may have been spread,

947
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:26,636
by those who want
the current regime to collapse.

948
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:33,434
Until Ha-na is safely reunited
with her father Dr. Jung,

949
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,062
don't trust anybody.

950
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:40,233
Don't even trust me. [scoffs]

951
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,527
-[loud rumble]
-[yelps]

952
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,404
[clattering]

953
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:49,033
-[Carter] What's going on?
-Don't worry. I'll go investigate.

954
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:51,494
[breathes deeply]

955
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:56,707
-What's going on?
-We've lost contact with the cockpit.

956
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,084
What?

957
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:00,503
[frantic music playing]

958
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:03,965
-[agent] Director Kim, what's going on?
-[reporter] Is there a problem?

959
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,885
Hurry, we need a medic!

960
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:12,890
What happened?

961
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:15,935
They both just collapsed.
But they just drank coffee.

962
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:21,524
Coffee?

963
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,651
Sir, I didn't do it.

964
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,529
Look, I brought the coffee
but that was it.

965
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:28,614
[suspenseful music playing]

966
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:45,506
No, you can't! Who else can fly the plane?

967
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:47,758
Look at his bloodshot eyes.

968
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:51,137
This plane's going down in ten minutes
if it's a mutated variant.

969
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,848
What do you think you're doing?

970
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:57,727
Director Kim tried to kill
Comrade Pilot and Comrade Assistant Pilot.

971
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:01,606
If we don't kill them, we will all die!

972
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:03,190
Everyone, calm down.

973
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:05,151
First we'll confirm they're infected.

974
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:06,068
Medic!

975
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,448
[tense music playing]

976
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:20,583
[device beeps]

977
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,630
[official] How does it look?

978
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:26,964
Technically,

979
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:31,510
in normal situations, this level
wouldn't be considered high enough,

980
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,930
but considering
the altitude and cabin pressure,

981
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,598
technically, this is an infection.

982
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:37,808
[Director Kim]
So, are they infected or not?

983
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:40,102
Give us more time to observe it.

984
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:43,356
At least give us five minutes
to get a proper reading.

985
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,900
What's the difference
in killing them now or then?

986
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,196
Hang on. But his hair roots are strong.

987
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,782
Don't you know it's too late
once the hair starts falling out?

988
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:55,576
The protocol states that
reading times are to be observed.

989
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,746
If anything happens in the meantime,
they will instantly be shot.

990
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:00,456
[engine powering down]

-[woman gasps]
-[alarm sounding]

992
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,251
[official] Open the blinds in the cabin!

993
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:06,712
The blinds, they aren't working.

994
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:11,092
Why is the medical room
emergency lights off?

995
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:13,761
Out of my way.

996
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:16,555
-Move!
-[official] Director Kim!

997
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,516
Director Kim, what's the situation?

998
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:20,768
Due to what felt like extreme turbulence,

999
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:23,062
we appear to have lost power on board.

1000
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:24,772
Now, that is an extremely…

1001
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:28,150
[Jung Hee] Carter.
Only you can hear what I'm saying.

1002
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,278
In the cargo compartment,
I am sensing the heat signatures

1003
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,239
of what appear to be an adult and Ha-na.

1004
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:36,701
-The cargo compartment?
-[Jung Hee] You need to head there.

1005
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:39,120
-[agent] Let's go.
-[man] This is why South Korean bastards…

1006
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:40,746
-You can never trust them.
-[agent] Ha-na!

1007

-Why are you doing this?
-[laughs]

01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:17,366
Your eyes really say
that you don't remember anything.

1016

[panting]

1017
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,037
-What?
-Yeah. Yeah.

1018
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,913
If you don't remember anything,

1019
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:26,167
at least you'll be at peace
when you die, right?

01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:41,599
[man] Director Kim.

1025
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,185
Why… Why are you doing this?

1026
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,854
Ri Cheol Ju, you son of a bitch!

1027
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:49,231
Ha-na, are you all right?

1028
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,816
-[Ha-na] Yes.
-Don't move!

[Cheol Ju gasps]

1030
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:55,279
Who is it?
Who's the head of the North Korean coup?

1031
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:58,866
Who spread this virus? Who created it!?

1032
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:01,327
[laughs]

1033
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:04,872
Do you really think North Korea would
make this mess just to die

1034
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:08,084
and when we don't even have a vaccine yet?

1035
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:09,585
[laughs]

1036
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:11,712
But have you considered that maybe,

1037
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:16,467
it's the South that wanted the coup?

1038
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:18,928
[laughs]

1039
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:20,387
I guess you,

1040
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:24,600
are just another facet of this
to make it more interesting.

1041
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:27,686
Now that's enough of your bullshit.
Just answer me.

1042
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:28,604
Who is it?

1043
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:30,356

Director Kim.

1048
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,575
You're embarrassing yourself,

1049
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:46,831
You believe those stereotypes, huh?
You think I have loyalty to the North?

1050
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:51,460
What, 'cause I'm from North Korea?
Is that it then?

1052
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,213
What?

1053
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:58,259
Do you think there's only one spy
like him in the North?

-[laughs]
-Ri Cheol Ju, you asshole!

1055
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:03,472
Are you working with the United States?

01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:13,107
Up there in the North,

1060
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:17,528

an American colony.

1061
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:19,572
The thing is,

1062
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:23,325
after having met these Americans,

1063
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,579
it looks like being on their side,

1064
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:29,665
is more than worth it for me.

1065
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,001
America.

1066
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:34,545
Its freedom and equality.

1067
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:38,591

and all its opportunity.

1068

Listen, Director Kim was just a CIA spy
that was planted here.

1120
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,847
He was trying to take Ha-na away.

would do this!

Hey, hey, hey. Whoa! Calm down, okay?
Put the guns away for a second.

You can't just accept

Ask Ha-na.

1128

Is that true, Ha-na?

1129

[Jung Hee] If you follow the valley down

there's a cliff and a rope bridge.

1243
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:14,406
We are moving
to the opposite side now too.

1244
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:17,367
The mission will be complete
once you get there.

So you're Ha-na. You've done a lot.

1300
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:01,210
Thank you for your hard work.
Now we can leave together.

A job well done.

1306
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:32,492
It's a surprise
that you would love a woman

1307
01:29:32,575 --> 01:29:34,327
and a daughter that you two had

1308
01:29:35,244 --> 01:29:38,247
while you were working undercover. Hmm?

1309
01:29:43,961 --> 01:29:46,631
And I applaud you
for putting your life at risk,

01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:48,966
to protect your own daughter.

1311

Oh.

1313
01:29:58,518 --> 01:29:59,936
I'm Kim Jong Hyeok.

1314
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:05,858
You know, seeing what you're capable of,

1315
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:09,362
you sure don't seem
like you lost your memory.

Once the device implanted
in your ear is removed,

Where are you taking Carter? Tell me.

Look here, Han Jung Hee.

1336
01:31:41,037 --> 01:31:43,289
Don't make a scene. And stand down.

1337
01:31:43,789 --> 01:31:45,374
But you made us a promise!

1338
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:50,046
We could leave this country
after Carter had finished the mission.

1339
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:52,924
That deal was between you and the party.

1340
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:56,260
I have never made such a promise.

1341
01:31:58,095 --> 01:31:59,847
Then what does that mean?

1342
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:03,100
Put her in the car.

1343
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:09,315

the most competent
female comrade in the North,

1355
01:32:50,481 --> 01:32:54,110

Huh?

Look, just make your point.

I knew it from the first moment,

all those pricks in South Korea
who only think about money,

1361

and even those arrogant
American imperialist bastards,

1362
01:33:18,634 --> 01:33:20,970
can be destroyed in one strike.

1363
01:33:22,638 --> 01:33:25,850
It's a once in a lifetime chance
from the heavens.

Where are you taking me?

1375
01:34:09,268 --> 01:34:12,855
Just keep quiet,
and your wife will make the decision.

who I once loved

1379

Who knows, huh?

1390
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:32,059
You might walk away a North Korean hero
and ex spy agent,

1391
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:35,146
or you might become barbecue in this fire.

1392

Don't worry though, it'll be decided soon.

01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:42,862

01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:21,335
Kim Jong Hyeok, tell me where he is.

1418
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:27,174
[soldier] He's at, uh, the Sinuiju
Chemical Factory's biochemical facilities

1419
01:37:27,258 --> 01:37:29,969
about 1.5 kilometers to the north--

1420
01:37:30,052 --> 01:37:31,136
[gun fires]

1421
01:37:32,805 --> 01:37:33,889
[grunts]

1422
01:37:33,973 --> 01:37:35,975
[suspenseful music playing]

[solemn music playing]

1428
01:38:59,683 --> 01:39:00,684
[grunts softly]

1429
01:39:11,987 --> 01:39:13,989
[solemn music continues]

1430
01:39:52,194 --> 01:39:58,117
I'M GOING TO CALL YOU
KEEP ME ON THE PHONE - CARTER

1431
01:40:01,954 --> 01:40:03,956
[line ringing]

1432
01:40:14,299 --> 01:40:16,552
[Jong Hyeok] You look like
you still haven't decided.

1433
01:40:17,636 --> 01:40:19,096
Don't overthink it.

1434
01:40:27,062 --> 01:40:29,064
You need to save your family,

1435
01:40:30,649 --> 01:40:32,651
Carter, yourself, and your daughter.

1436
01:40:34,194 --> 01:40:35,904
I can guarantee their safety.

1437
01:40:37,573 --> 01:40:40,075
Let us go, like the party had promised.

1438
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:43,537
I don't care what you do here,

1439
01:40:44,747 --> 01:40:46,206
what you do with North Korea.

1440
01:40:48,667 --> 01:40:50,294
Well, maybe you should care.

1441
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:53,130
For instance,

1442
01:40:54,256 --> 01:40:55,758
if you two work with the Americans

1443
01:40:55,841 --> 01:40:59,053
and were to say all sorts of bullshit
to the entire world,

1444
01:41:00,554 --> 01:41:01,638
how will I look?

1445
01:41:04,516 --> 01:41:06,518
I'll most likely get furious

1446
01:41:07,561 --> 01:41:09,772
and drag you all here again

1447
01:41:11,732 --> 01:41:15,235
to bury you all deep within
that anthrax incinerator

1448
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:19,406
But then again… [sighs]

1449
01:41:20,032 --> 01:41:23,368
…if Carter Lee,
who saved the North from the virus,

1450
01:41:24,244 --> 01:41:26,038
were to stand with me and my men,

1451
01:41:26,914 --> 01:41:29,625
your husband will become a new idol

1452
01:41:30,501 --> 01:41:32,419
in uniting all of North Korea.

1453
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:33,504
[scoffs]

1454
01:41:34,671 --> 01:41:35,672
Idol, huh?

1455
01:41:38,634 --> 01:41:42,513
You just want a puppet, don't you,
who will do as you please?

1456
01:41:43,305 --> 01:41:47,726
Look, if it means he survives
then being a puppet is a small price.

1457
01:41:48,477 --> 01:41:49,478
Am I wrong?

1458
01:41:52,356 --> 01:41:53,607
Lieutenant General.

1459
01:41:56,110 --> 01:42:00,239
As I'm looking at you, threatening me
that you'll kill my husband,

1460
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:03,200
I'm not seeing

1461
01:42:03,826 --> 01:42:05,035
any new world

1462
01:42:06,161 --> 01:42:08,122
for the North Korean people.

1463
01:42:14,419 --> 01:42:17,297
I was certain you'd been blinded by a man,

1464
01:42:19,299 --> 01:42:22,177
but you've been blinded
to your immediate future as well.

1465
01:42:33,564 --> 01:42:35,107
I can't plan the future

1466
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:38,902
of the People's Republic

1467
01:42:39,903 --> 01:42:42,114
with someone who's as blind as you are.

This is the room. Yoon Hee is in here.

01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:52,226
-[Carter] Where is she?
-Huh? No, where is she?

1486
01:43:52,309 --> 01:43:54,311

Ha-na.

1501
01:44:33,308 --> 01:44:34,476
It's all right.

1502
01:44:34,559 --> 01:44:36,353
These people are just researchers.

1503
01:44:36,436 --> 01:44:38,522
[Jung Hee] Doctor, our daughter…

1504
01:44:43,902 --> 01:44:45,779
[Dr. Jung] You've been infected as well.

1505
01:44:45,862 --> 01:44:48,323

[gun fires]

1548
01:48:24,206 --> 01:48:28,043
Seven minutes ago, a train operated
by the… the Chinese government

1549
01:48:28,126 --> 01:48:31,004
left Ryung Gye for Dandong,
carrying the infected.

1550
01:48:31,671 --> 01:48:34,257
Not even the North Korean government
can interfere with that train,

1551
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:36,468
so we need to stop it.

1552
01:48:37,302 --> 01:48:40,138
But we need to get your memory back first.

1553
01:48:41,348 --> 01:48:42,182
Doctor.

1554
01:48:42,724 --> 01:48:44,893
If you open his stitches,
you'll see a device.

1555
01:48:44,976 --> 01:48:47,646
If you plug this into it,
his memories will return.

1556
01:48:53,068 --> 01:48:54,236

01:49:36,653 --> 01:49:38,738
-[Yoon Hee] Dad…
-[Carter] I'll get Ha-na to the North.

1563
01:49:38,822 --> 01:49:40,699
Dr. Jung is with me at the moment.

[vehicle doors slamming]

1573
01:50:06,683 --> 01:50:10,020
The country is falling into ruins
because of the virus.

1574
01:50:11,104 --> 01:50:14,232
So do you think it wise
that our Comrade hero of the Republic

1575
01:50:14,316 --> 01:50:17,235
is abandoning the country
during a time such as this?

1576
01:50:18,778 --> 01:50:20,405
Let us go. I beg you.

1577
01:50:21,906 --> 01:50:23,283
Lieutenant General, please.

1578
01:50:23,867 --> 01:50:25,243
Just let us go, please.

1579
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:29,164
So you still haven't come
to your senses, Comrade.

1580
01:50:30,373 --> 01:50:31,625
Have you forgotten

1581
01:50:32,459 --> 01:50:35,211
that having your child
was the party's decision?

1582
01:50:37,255 --> 01:50:38,882
Please tell your superiors

1583
01:50:39,591 --> 01:50:43,261
if you… if you swear
to release our family,

1584
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:45,930
I'll get Ha-na to the North.

1585
01:50:47,515 --> 01:50:48,975
Do you know what you've said?

1586
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:50,685
What it will do

1587
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:54,439
to you, your daughter, and your wife?

1588
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:59,110
No one knows specifically
if the CIA moved Ha-na out already,

1589
01:50:59,778 --> 01:51:02,989
or if she's still hidden somewhere
in South Korea.

1590
01:51:03,948 --> 01:51:07,410
I can find her if I become bait
and approach the CIA on my own.

1591
01:51:08,328 --> 01:51:10,455
I don't side with the North or America,

1592
01:51:10,538 --> 01:51:12,624
so it won't be an international conflict.

1593
01:51:17,003 --> 01:51:18,880
How can I trust you'll do it though,

1596
01:51:27,764 --> 01:51:30,809
If you run, and abandon
your wife and your daughter,

1597
01:51:31,726 --> 01:51:36,272
that will only mean exposure
of our entire operation.

1598
01:51:39,275 --> 01:51:40,151
Then, um…

1599
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:44,364
BD-7 can erase everything that I know.

1600
01:51:46,282 --> 01:51:47,826
Use it and send me South.

How do you know that information?

1604
01:51:56,584 --> 01:51:58,336
Just give us this one chance.

1605
01:51:59,421 --> 01:52:01,589
And I'll get Ha-na
to the North, you'll see.

1606
01:52:03,007 --> 01:52:04,426
In exchange, you let us go.
