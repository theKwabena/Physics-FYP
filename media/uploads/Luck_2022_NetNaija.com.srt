to find a forever family,

178
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,614
and the older you get, the harder it is.

179
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,909
She's meeting a new couple on Sunday.

180
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,912
If I could just give her
a little good luck…

181
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,832
But you can't give someone
something you've never had.

182
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,836
Still, if I could,

183
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:18,298
and if good luck was something
you could actually hold in your hand,

184
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,217
I'd give it all to Hazel.

185
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,719
So that maybe she could find
her forever family

186
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,764
and not end up alone like me,

187
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:28,016
sitting on a curb,

188
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,726
talking to a cat.

189
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,104
Oh!

190
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,191
You're welcome!

191
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,115
Well, what do you know, Hazel.

192
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:50,247
Find a penny, pick it up,
and all day long, you'll have good luck.

193
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,042

[gasps, exclaims]

204
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:40,148
Lucky pennies are real.

205
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:45,279
Ms. Rivera, hi.
Is it okay if I stop by after work later?

206
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:48,365
I have something special
for Hazel for her visit tomorrow.

207
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,449
Oh, great.

208
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:52,411
Oh, and please don't tell her.
I want it to be a surprise.

209
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,247
Whoo-hoo!

210
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,500
Yes! Yes. Yes, yes, yes!

211
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,172
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

212
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:04,882
Boom.

213
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,177
Hi, Marv.

214
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:14,558
Whoa!

215
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,820
-Well, somebody found their groove.
-[both laugh]

216
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,697
No cart patrol for you tomorrow.

217
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,158
I got a pallet of glassware
with your name on it.

218
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,118
-Sounds great.
-Have a nice night.

219
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:36,622
Thanks. I will.
I'm off to surprise my friend Hazel.

220
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:52,346

[beeps, flushes]

228
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:43,730
[grunts] My stupid bad luck.

229

[groans]

230
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,943
You're back.

231
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:52,906
[sighs] So, remember I told you
I wanted good luck for my friend Hazel

232
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,241
for her visit tomorrow?

233
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,659
Well, guess what?

234
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,579
After you left last night, I found some.

235
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:02,791
That's right.
I found an actual lucky penny.

236
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,711
And what did I do?
I flushed it down the toilet.

237
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,212
You did what?

238
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,590
You flushed my penny down the toilet?

239
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:11,508
What did you do that for?

240
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,553
You just talked.

241
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:15,846
[gasps]

242
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,182
[gasps]

243
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:20,809
It was you.

244
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:23,937
You gave me that lucky penny.

245
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:27,191
Please, I just need one more.

246
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:28,650
Wait!

247
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:30,652
Wait! Come back!

248
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:32,404
-[bell rings]
-Whoa!

249
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,203

254
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:21,912
Whoa!

255
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:26,917
[grunts] Whoa!

256
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:32,840
[pants] Huh?

257
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,377
I just need a penny for my friend Hazel.

258
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:14,548
[grunting]

259
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:16,884

[grunts]

261
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:27,769
Huh?

262
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,072
[grunts]

263
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,200

[sighs]

267
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:04,056
[cat] How was my day? Oh, it was lovely!
Thank you. Just brilliant.

268
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,642
Lost my travel penny
and was chased across the city

269
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:09,061
by an unrelenting human zombie.

270
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,232
Ugh.
Always with the obnoxiously long password.

271
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,400
-[thrums, whirs]
-Oh, got it.

272
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:28,622
[gasps]

[shouts]

275
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:49,560
Now, about that penny problem.
Why you talking to yourself, Bob?

276
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:53,063
Oh, just practicing so when I'm banished
forever, I'll have someone to talk to--

277
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,148
-[yelps, grunting]
-[screams]

278
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:56,942
No, no, no, no.

279
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,110
[grunting]

280
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:01,697
[screams]
What manner of crazy human are you?

281
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,283
What kind of a crazy talking cat are you?

282
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:06,076
A lucky Scottish one, obviously.

283
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,870
But black cats aren't lucky.

284
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:11,999
Ha! In Scotland, black cats are considered
very lucky, thank you very much.

285
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:13,750
-Is this Scotland?
-No!

286
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:16,420
And humans cannot be here.

287
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:19,423
-Where's "here"?
-You need to leave. Now.

288
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:21,884
Oh, I'll leave, no problem,

289
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:24,094
as soon as you give me
another lucky penny.

290
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:26,346
I did not give you a penny.

291
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:31,018
It fell out of my collar when you lured me
over with that tasty meat bread.

292
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,561
It's called a panini.

293
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:36,523
Whatever. It was all just a ploy
to steal my travel penny.

294
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:37,608
Travel penny?

295
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:40,652
We creatures from the Land of Luck
aren't lucky in your world,

296
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:42,654
so we carry some with us just to be safe.

297
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:45,407
Did you just say, "Land of Luck"?

298
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,659
-[voices speak indistinctly]
-[yelps] Hide, hide, hide!

299
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:52,414
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

300
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:55,834
Welcome back, Bob. Arrived back
18 hundred hours and six minutes.

301
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:57,628
Leprechauns?

302
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,755
Anything unusual happen on the other side?

303
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,507
-[device whirs]
-Nope.

304
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:06,094
[device beeping]

305
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:09,139
[leprechaun 1] Oh, I see you located
one blocked luck line.

306
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:10,974
That construction site. No wonder.

307
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:15,187
Yep, looks like Paulie's popcorn pop-up
is putting down roots.

308
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,815
[chuckles] Not a problem.
Two ticks and around she goes.

309
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:21,360
[leprechaun 1]
I'd wager three might do the trick.

310
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,780
[leprechaun 2, chuckles]
Right you are, Quinn.

311
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:27,115
Luck flowing freely once again.

312
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:30,994
Say, you guys seen Gerry around?
He's usually here to check me in.

313
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:34,331
Oh, he's down at the Penny Depot.
They needed an extra hand.

314
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,415
Penny Depot?

315
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:37,334
[Quinn]
So we're covering his line cat returns.

316
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:41,421
Oh, and Gerry said he always turns in
your travel penny for ya,

317
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:43,048
so we'll be taking that now.

318
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,383
Uh-oh.

319
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:47,719
You know what,
I'll just turn it in myself today.

320
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:50,305
Uh, if you say so, Bob.
Good luck with that.

321
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:54,393
Yeah. Say hi to the Captain for us.
We know how much she loves you.

322
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:55,853
But she doesn't love him.

323
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:57,896
-[Quinn] I was being ironical.
-You're so clever.

324
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,189
What have I done?

325
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:01,275
I wasn't supposed to stop
and eat human food.

326
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,735
I definitely wasn't supposed to talk
in front of a human.

327
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:07,573
And I sure as heck wasn't supposed to let
the human who lost my travel penny

328
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:09,283
follow me through the portal!

329
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:13,620
Okay, but those leprechauns just said
something about a Penny Depot.

330
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:15,038
Maybe we could get one there.

331
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:19,418
Only leprechauns are allowed inside,
and you are not a leprechaun!

332
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:21,503
But maybe I could be.

333
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:22,588
[laughs] What?

334
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:25,632
You think you're just gonna march
down to the leprechaun locker room

335
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:27,384
and-- and-- and borrow some clothes?

336
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,262
-Brilliant idea. Let's go.
-No, wait. Stop!

337
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:31,972
Just stop!

338
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:35,100
Hey, Bob. Everything okay?

339
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:38,562
Aye, just, uh, stretching my legs.
[grunts]

340
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:39,730
Okeydokey.

341
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:41,064
[grunts]

342
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:45,527
Even if you could masquerade as
some freakishly big leprechaun,

343
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:48,906
I can't get past the Captain
without turning in a penny.

344
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:51,366
What if you turned in this?

345
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,744
This is a button.

346
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:56,205
And at some point, they will discover it,

347
00:24:56,288 --> 00:25:00,959
and if I don't have a lucky penny in hand
when they do, I'll be banished.

348
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:04,963
Okay,
but maybe the button buys us a little time

349
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:07,466
until we get a lucky penny
from the Penny Depot.

350
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:10,093
-Then I'll borrow it for my frie--
-For your friend Hazel.

351
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:11,887
Yes, I've got that part.

352
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:15,182
What? You said it, like, a hundred times.

353
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:18,060
We'll go to the Penny Depot
to get one penny.

354
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:20,771
I use it first, and then it's all yours.

355
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:23,857
And then I'll leave.

356
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:27,694
You'll never see my face again.

357
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:32,407
Great. I'm Sam, by the way.

358
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:35,827
This is strictly business.
Names are unimportant.

359
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:38,997
But I already heard them call you Bob.

360
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:40,958
Oh, fine. Yes, it's Bob.

361
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:46,547
Whoo. Welcome back, line cats.
Now, drop your pennies and move along.

362
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,298
That's it. Let's go, kitty cats.

363
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:49,883
Drop your travel pennies.

364
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:51,969
-[coins clinking]
-[beeps]

365
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:53,303
Keep it moving.

366
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:56,306
Ah, sector 64 today, Joanie.

367
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,641
Oh, Nigeria.

368
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,060
[beeping]

369
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:03,188
Catch you on the flip side, Cap.

370
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:06,483
-That's the Captain?
-Aye, that's her.

371
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:08,443
She really doesn't like me.

372
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:10,571
Maybe she's not a cat person.

373
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:12,781
Well, she likes the other cats just fine.

374
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:15,033
So, what's the plan?

375
00:26:15,117 --> 00:26:18,912
Right. You sneak out that door over there.
I'll keep the Captain busy.

376
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:21,915
When you're clear, I'll drop in the button
and meet you on the other side.

377
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:24,293
Simple. Good luck to us both.

378
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:30,674
Ooh,
the sweet clankety-clack of lucky pennies.

379
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:32,843
There's no better sound in the world.

380
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:35,929
Bob, what are you waiting for?
Drop your penny.

381
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:37,514
Aye, I got it right here, Cap.

382
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:39,975
But first, how's your day been so far?

383
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:41,685
Okay, Bob, what are you up to?

384
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:45,314
[chuckles] Why can't a cat ask
how his boss's day is going?

385
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:46,982
Because it's weird, Bob.

386
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:50,110
Because you never have asked me
anything, Bob.

387
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:52,321
Because we don't even like
each other, Bob.

388
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:57,868
Because you give me the heebie-jeebies,
and you always have, Bob.

389
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:00,871
Oh, is that all? All righty then.

390
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:03,957
Say, Captain, do you like jokes?

391
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,168
Only the funny ones, Bob.

392
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:09,421
[chuckles]
Right. Well, then you'll love this one.

393
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:11,256
Why did the penny arrest the nickel?

394
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,384
I don't know, Bob. Why?

395
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:16,553
Because she was a copper.

396
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:20,265
[laughs]

397
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:22,684
[wheezing, laughing continues]

398
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:24,394
[muttering indistinctly]

399
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:25,479
Wasn't funny.

400
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,272
Yeah, not my best.

401
00:27:27,356 --> 00:27:31,151
-Catch you later, Cap.
-Not if I catch you first, Bob.

402
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:33,403
Leprechaun locker room, here we come.

403
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:35,614
[Captain]
Welcome back, Shirley. Keep it moving.

404
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:38,992
[Sam] Not to pry, but do you have fingers?

405
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:41,703
Thumbs. I'm polydactyl.

406
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:46,124
"Gerry." That's your friend, right?

407
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:48,043
Eh, he's more like my assistant.

408
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:49,795
You sure he won't mind?

409
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:51,338
[scoffs] Gerry never minds.

410
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,340
And enough with the questions.

411
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:56,718
Strictly business, remember?
We don't need to get to know each other.

412
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:58,053
-Yeah, okay.
-[toilet flushes]

413
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:00,389
[leprechaun]
Then he says, "Are you a River dancer?"

414
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:02,140
[gasps] We forgot to check the lavvy.

415
00:28:02,224 --> 00:28:03,684
-Hurry, before somebody sees.
-[gasps]

416
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:07,229
-And then he did a little jig.
-A jig? No. [gasps] You have to show--

417
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:08,939
-Good afternoon, ladies.
-[gasps]

418
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:11,233
What are you doing in here, Bob?

419
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:14,152
Aye, line cats have their own locker room.

420
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:17,656
Oh, I-- I-- I was just, uh--
Well, I was, um--

421
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:19,700
-You know--
-[Sam] He was helping me.

422
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:24,288
He's my Land of Luck
leprechaun orientation guide.

423
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:28,333
-Deary me, you're a big lass.
-Aye.

424
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:30,669
I'm Sam.

425
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:31,879
Where ya from?

426
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:36,884
She, uh-- She's from, uh--
Uh, you know, uh--

427
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:40,345
Latvia! That's right. She's from Latvia.

428
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:43,265
[giggles]

429
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,645
Hey, Saoirse, didn't Clodagh say she met
a Latvian guy down at the Hairy Lemon,

430
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:50,564
and that he was a real big fella too?

431
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:51,899
Aye, she did.

432
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:55,986
Well, cheers to Latvia
for growing 'em big. [chuckles]

433
00:28:56,069 --> 00:29:00,949
Guess not all lucky creatures are
teeny-toaty like us, eh? [laughs, sighs]

434
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:03,994
-Nice meeting you.
-Enjoy the rest of your tour.

435
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:07,289
-Don't do anything we wouldn't do.
-[leprechaun] Oh, you're shameless.

436
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:09,333
They were so sweet and tiny.

437
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,127
And surprisingly less clever than usual.

438
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:13,921
[chuckles] They totally bought it.

439
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:15,380
Next stop, lucky penny.

440
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:17,424
-Right.
-And then, you leave.

441
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:18,800
-[Sam] Right.
-Say it with me.

442
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:21,553
-And then you leave.
-No, you leave.

443
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:23,805
Yeah, I know. It was a joke.

444
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:29,144
[gasps]

445
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:34,816
[Bob] Welcome to the Land of Luck.

446
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:39,112
[Sam] Incredible.

447
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:46,370
Hey, there.

448
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:56,338
Uh-huh.

449
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,390
Morning.

450
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:09,643
This way.
We'll be at the Penny Depot in no time.

451
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:12,688
-Follow me right onto the disc.
-Okay.

452
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:14,398
Here we go.

453
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:16,275
Just smile and wave.

454
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:19,653
-Hey, Bob. Lunch this week?
-Aye, let's do it.

455
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:21,488
Okay, it's transfer time.

456
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:26,493
[machine whirring, clinking]

457
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:33,208
-Morning, Bob.
-Hi, Betty.

458
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:37,296
So far, so good, Sam.
No one's even noticed ya. [chuckles]

459
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:39,923
[gasps] Sam? Sam?

460
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:41,508
[gasps]

461
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:43,135
Sam!

462
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,182
You hear about Joe?
He just joined the luck makers' union.

463
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:50,517
That's great. He's hilarious.

464
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:52,019
Whoa. [exclaims]

465
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:55,147
[gasps, grunting]

466
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,693
[gasps]

467
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:03,864
[grunting, exclaiming]

468
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:07,826
[yelps]

469
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:10,621
[breathes deeply]

470
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:14,833
Just how unlucky are you?

471
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:18,003
Yeah, super-duper unlucky.

472
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:21,423
Well, I wish you would have made that
clear before we shook on our little deal.

473
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:24,510
Oh! [chuckles] Hi, guys. Hi, there.

474
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:27,679
Just checking on the rail grips. [groans]

475
00:31:27,763 --> 00:31:30,682
-There is no unlucky here.
-[grunting]

476
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:34,561
So if you want that lucky penny for your
wee friend, you best start blending in.

477
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:36,939
Uh, that's what I was trying to do.

478
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:38,232
Aha!

479
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:40,275
Well, that was your first mistake.

480
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:42,528
Lucky creatures don't try.

481
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:43,779
They don't have to.

482
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:46,490
And stop sweating.
They don't do that either.

483
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:47,908
Right, okay.

484
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:49,785
-I'll try my best.
-Uh-uh.

485
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:53,121
I mean,
I'll try to act like I'm not trying.

486
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:55,290
Good answer.

487
00:31:58,043 --> 00:31:59,461
We've got to find Gerry.

488
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:02,214
He'll know
how all this penny business works.

489
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:04,299
He'll be the super cheery one in green.

490
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:08,011
They all look like that.

491
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:11,557
Slainte, friends. What is the story?

492
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,016
There he is.

493
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,395
-O'Neill!
-[munches, slurps]

494
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:17,980
O'Reilly, O'Donoghue.

495
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:20,691
-[speaks indistinctly]
-Barry.

496
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:25,279
And I didn't forget you, Clarisse.

497
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:28,073
-I've got your microbrew right here.
-Thanks, Gerry!

498
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:30,701
-Is he thoughtful or what?
-Gerry!

499
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:35,247
Sam, Gerry.

500
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,915
Oh, you're grand.

501
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,878
Um, are those my clothes?

502
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:43,422
Sorry, Bob said you wouldn't mind.

503
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:46,508
Uh, Sam's visiting from Latvia. Her
clothes got all messed up on arrival and--

504
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,428
[gasps] So, you live in the human world?

505
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:50,596
Uh, usually.

506
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:54,683
Oh, man!
Have you ever tried grilled cheese?

507
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:55,976
I have.

508
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,144
[whimpers]

509
00:32:57,227 --> 00:33:01,398
Right. So, Ger, as you know,
cats aren't allowed inside the Depot,

510
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,942
and Sam's a wee bit nervous
about her first shift.

511
00:33:04,026 --> 00:33:08,238
So I was thinking maybe you could escort
her in and, you know, show her the ropes.

512
00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:10,782
Lucky me. Of course.

513
00:33:10,866 --> 00:33:12,784
So, it's super easy.

514
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:14,536
You sit in the chair,
the penny comes to you,

515
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,246
you polish it up and send it on its way.

516
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,915
Sounds like something I can handle.

517
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:19,291
Of course you can.

518
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:21,877
Lucky leprechauns were made
for this kind of work.

519
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,588
-[Irish jig music playing]
-[whistle blows]

520
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,215
Ooh. That's us.

521
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:30,010
-Uh-uh.
-[chuckling] Go ahead. I'll catch up.

522
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:31,303
[Gerry] Okeydoke.

523
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:33,388
Um, I think we should abort.

524
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:34,890
What, why?

525
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:36,975
You're not a lucky leprechaun, Sam.

526
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:39,478
You're an insanely unlucky human.

527
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:41,980
-Or maybe you've forgotten.
-Trust me. I haven't.

528
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:43,398
You'll cause a disaster.

529
00:33:43,482 --> 00:33:46,985
Maybe not. Gerry said we sit
in chairs and polish pennies.

530
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:49,780
And I imagine to polish a penny,
you need to hold a penny.

531
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:51,657
And if I'm holding a lucky penny--

532
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,909
I get it. You'll be lucky.

533
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:56,745
Pocket one penny. How hard could it be?

534
00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:00,123
[Gerry] Sam, over here.

535
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:02,501
-You'll sit right next to me.
-Thanks, Gerry.

536
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:06,839
Okay, leprechauns,
let's get these pennies in tip-top shape.

537
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:08,924
The Captain is depending on us.

538
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:12,469
-[blows whistle] It's penny time!
-[Irish jig music playing]

539
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:19,768
Remember, there is nothing to it.
Just stay in your chair.

540
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:24,898
Grab a penny, Sam.

541
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,407
-[grunts]
-[leprechauns yelping]

542
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:17,826
[grunting]

543
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:18,994
[all] Whoa!

544
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:21,830
[grunting, yelping continues]

545
00:35:21,914 --> 00:35:23,332
[grunts, groans]

546
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:27,753
[gasps]

547
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:35,469
[alarm blares]

548
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,262
[stammers] Uh, don't panic.

549
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:38,764
[leprechauns muttering]

550
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:40,682
You think it was
a bad luck speck that did it?

551
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:42,392
More like a whole boot full.

552
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:43,894
Sam!

553
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:46,146
I told you this would be a disaster.

554
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,566
Well, I didn't expect to get the button.
You saw that, right?

555
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,901
Oh, yes, I saw it.

556
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:54,571
And now that button's headed
straight back to Arrivals and Departures,

557
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:56,490
where the Captain will see it for sure.

558
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:58,367
So, where are we gonna find a penny now?

559
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,327
[stammers] We're not!

560
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,829
This was it, our one chance.

561
00:36:02,913 --> 00:36:04,414
And now you leave.

562
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:07,793
No, no, no.
The deal was I leave after we get a penny.

563
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:11,505
The deal is off.
There's nowhere else to get a penny.

564
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:12,798
Someone need a penny?

565
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:14,132
Bob does.

566
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:16,510
He lost his,
and then I flushed it down the toilet--

567
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:18,595
-Sam!
-What? He's your friend.

568
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:21,139
-Assistant.
-This is terrible, Bob.

569
00:36:21,223 --> 00:36:23,559
You stopped to eat human food again,
didn't you?

570
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:25,978
-Yeah. My human food.
-Sam!

571
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:27,896
What do you mean, your human food?

572
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,858
I'm not a Latvian leprechaun, Gerry.
I'm a human.

573
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:32,484
-[shudders]
-[groans]

574
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:36,446
Humans cannot be here!

575
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,906
Yeah, Bob mentioned that.

576
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:42,703
So, you lost your travel penny
and brought a human through the portal.

577
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:44,580
Oh, the Captain is not gonna like this.

578
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:47,541
And if she finds out,
you'll be banished to Bad Luck!

579
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:49,626
Wait. There's a Bad Luck here too?

580
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,671
Well, not here, here,
but down there, here, yeah.

581
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:54,464
It's the other half of our world.

582
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:57,050
Good Luck on top
and Bad Luck on the bottom,

583
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:58,802
only their half isn't so nice.

584
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:02,389
Of course, it isn't.
Bad luck ruins everything it touches.

585
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:04,766
Why didn't you tell me that's
where you'll be banished, Bob?

586
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:07,686
-You never asked.
-Because you said no more questions.

587
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:09,229
[sirens wailing]

588
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:11,023
They called in the hazmats.

589
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:28,332
[screams] It's the Captain. Quick, hide.

590
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:29,416
That might be tough.

591
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,752
All right, everyone, clear out.

592
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:35,297
Evacuate the area
so the rabbits can do their work.

593
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:39,760
Bob, is that you?

594
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:41,094
Ah, no, Cap.

595
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:44,640
It's me, Gerry,
from Arrivals and Departures, remember?

596
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:48,477
-I've been working for you for 100 years--
-Gerry. Gerry. When did you grow a tail?

597
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,105
-Is the-- Is there a tail there?
-Captain, what a delight!

598
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:54,358
And so soon. Lucky me.

599
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:55,776
What are you doing down here?

600
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,362
Oh, just visiting my leprechaun friends.

601
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:00,531
You don't have friends, Bob.

602
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:04,201
They've scanned the crime scene, Captain,
and found no bad luck specks.

603
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:05,452
Scan it again.

604
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:09,540
One speck can de-luckify
an entire pile of lucky pennies.

605
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:12,209
Let's get outta here.

606
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:15,295
So, there's really no other place
to get a penny?

607
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:16,380
No!

608
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:18,966
What about the ones like Bob's
that go missing in the human world?

609
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:21,510
If they're so valuable,
why don't you go retrieve them?

610
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:23,512
-Oh, we do.
-We do?

611
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:24,638
Well, we used to.

612
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:27,432
But not one has been lost
since the Captain took over security.

613
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:30,310
The old days, if a travel penny
went missing in the human world,

614
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:32,479
-we'd send in the bunny drone.
-"Bunny drone"?

615
00:38:32,563 --> 00:38:36,525
Yeah. Clever little robot.
They keep it at Arrivals and Departures.

616
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:37,985
So, let's go get it.

617
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:40,445
Okay! But it hasn't been used in a decade.

618
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:43,282
So, first, we'll have to grab
a good luck crystal to power it.

619
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:45,993
-And where do we get one of those?
-The Luck Floor!

620
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:47,494
Whoa, whoa. Hold up a minute.

621
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:50,747
I'll head to Arrivals and Departures
and fire up the bunny drone

622
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:52,499
while you two sneak into Mission Control.

623
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:53,834
Wait. Why?

624
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:56,795
That's where they keep the joystick
that controls the drone.

625
00:38:56,879 --> 00:38:58,922
Great! But crystal first.

626
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:01,633
So, Luck Floor, here we come.

627
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:06,013
Ooh, but the crystals are up high.
We'll need someone tall to reach it.

628
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:08,307
-I'm tall.
-Not a chance.

629
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,642
-She's way too unlucky.
-It's true.

630
00:39:10,726 --> 00:39:14,062
Oh, she only has to grab one.
I think she can do it.

631
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:18,901
Oh, fine. I mean, what could go wrong?

632
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:20,611
That's the spirit, boss.

633
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,286
[whispering] Sounds like our little deal
is back on, Bob.

634
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:32,414
-[whispering] Yes, and then you'll leave.
-True to my word.

635
00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:35,292
So, where do we get the luck crystal?

636
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,794
[Gerry] We'll just walk down the hall
and snag one.

637
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:39,129
Piece of cake.

638
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:49,306
They're all staring right at Sam.
What do we do, boss?

639
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:55,521
She's from Latvia. Tallest leprechauns
in the world come from Latvia.

640
00:39:55,604 --> 00:39:58,982
And we're her Land of Luck
leprechaun orientation guides.

641
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:02,986
Lead on, Gerry.

642
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,738
Uh, right!

643
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:14,498
So, this is Good Luck R and D,
where good luck is created.

644
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:18,001
Finding your lost wedding ring
in the brownies?

645
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:20,379
Shirley always comes up
with the best stuff.

646
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:23,632
Wait. They actually think up
the good luck?

647
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:26,260
Yeah. Those two work in Happy Accidents,

648
00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:29,680
one of the many Good Luck departments
like Lucky in Love,

649
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:33,475
Front Row Parking Spot-- Ooh!
Right Place, Right Time.

650
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:35,435
You humans love that one.

651
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,565
And by "humans," you mean
the ones who live in the human world,

652
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:40,858
don't ya, Ger?

653
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:42,901
Exactly right.

654
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:46,530
Next, the lucky ideas are
stamped onto an idea leaf,

655
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:48,240
and then sent to the Luck Floor.

656
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:51,952
And luck passing through
in five, four, three, two…

657
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:54,705
Let's take this tour
to the upper level, shall we?

658
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:10,804
[Gerry] The ladybugs deliver the leaves
to the Pig Foreman.

659
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:12,431
And he makes the crystals?

660
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:14,558
Nah, they do.

661
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:20,063
Latvia. She's from Latvia. Latvia.

662
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,362
For the crystal.
Janice said I could borrow it.

663
00:41:27,446 --> 00:41:29,573
All right, luck makers!

664
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:32,034
We've got a full docket today!

665
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:34,828
Good morning, magical swine!

666
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:36,079
-A dragon?
-[pigs cheer]

667
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:37,831
Yeah, she's the CEO of Good Luck.

668
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:43,504
And the only creature
that can sniff out bad luck specks.

669
00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:45,005
Probably why she's here.

670
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:47,257
She must've heard what happened
at the Penny Depot.

671
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:49,968
[sniffing]

672
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:54,723
Uh, with your luck,
I wouldnae get too close.

673
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:57,935
Ta-da!

674
00:41:58,018 --> 00:42:00,437
There's not a speck of bad luck here.

675
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:04,149
-[cheering, whistling]
-Which means it's that time again.

676
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:08,612
Time to open your hearts
to do what only you can do.

677
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:11,990
-Let me hear it!
-Bring hope and joy to the world!

678
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:14,993
-[cheers, whistles]
-That's what good luck does.

679
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:18,539
The luck you create today
could change a life tomorrow.

680
00:42:20,499 --> 00:42:22,042
Have a lucky day, Phil.

681
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,460
You too, Boss.

682
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,677
[Phil] Okay, you heard her!

683
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,764
Let's make some good luck,
you prosperity-making wonder pigs!

684
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:37,057
[Bob] Duck down!

685
00:42:40,227 --> 00:42:41,478
[blowing]

686
00:42:46,608 --> 00:42:48,861
[Sam] They're doing it.
They're making the crystals.

687
00:42:48,944 --> 00:42:50,612
And we just need one for the bunny drone.

688
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:53,574
-This is it, Sam. Get ready.
-Ready.

689
00:42:53,657 --> 00:42:56,535

Way to go, team!

698
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:20,017
I'll go to Arrivals and Departures
and find the drone.

I know we'd still need

but why couldn't I just take Hazel
one of those?

706
00:43:41,997 --> 00:43:43,415
[Bob] It doesn't work that way.

707
00:43:43,498 --> 00:43:46,877
The good luck idea is stored
inside the crystal until it's released,

708
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,795
and there's only one thing
that can release it.

709

-What's that?
-The Randomizer.

710
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:53,133
It smashes the crystals into lucky dust,

711
00:43:53,217 --> 00:43:56,178
then sends it randomly
through the luck lines into your world.

712
00:43:56,261 --> 00:43:58,680
Wait. You're saying luck is random?

713
00:43:58,764 --> 00:44:01,934
Aye. Hence the name, Randomizer.

714
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:04,019
Look, it's happening right now.

715
00:44:04,603 --> 00:44:07,189
-[Sam] What are those?
-[Bob] The ancient luck stones.

716
00:44:07,272 --> 00:44:09,691
Like the batteries
that keep the arms spinning.

717
00:44:09,775 --> 00:44:12,694
The good luck stone draws in
the good luck from above,

718
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:15,864
and the bad luck stone draws in
the bad luck from below.

719
00:44:16,823 --> 00:44:18,784
And those must be the luck lines.

720
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:19,868
[Bob] Aye, that's them.

721
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:22,329
Like the power cords
connecting our worlds.

722
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:25,040
So, who makes the bad luck?

723
00:44:25,123 --> 00:44:26,583
Roots and goblins, mainly.

724
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:28,752

00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:31,255

We'll use that back one.
That way no one can see my screen.

00:45:03,704 --> 00:45:05,581
But how are we gonna distract the bunny?

00:51:56,950 --> 00:52:00,370
What? Oh, no you don't.
You are not leaving me down here.

862
00:52:00,454 --> 00:52:02,456
There's a tiny door.
You just have to find it.

863
00:52:02,539 --> 00:52:05,959
Go to Luck Tower 13,
right past the Lost Sock Dispensary.

864
00:52:06,043 --> 00:52:08,420
-What are you talking about?
-Listen to me.

865
00:52:08,504 --> 00:52:12,799
Tower 13 to the Dog Poop Research Center,
then find the purple light.

866
00:52:12,883 --> 00:52:14,092
Tiny door will be there,

867
00:52:14,176 --> 00:52:16,428
somewhere between "Stepped in It"
and "Tracked It in the House."

868
00:52:16,512 --> 00:52:17,346
Piece of cake.

869
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:19,806
But I'm not from here.

870
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:24,061
Ugh, right. Okay, this will really help.
The Bad Luck world is a mirror--

872
00:52:26,813 --> 00:52:32,569
Great. Okay, uh, Tower 13, Dog Poop

00:52:32,653 --> 00:52:35,113

901
00:54:07,206 --> 00:54:09,291
That's a lot of dog poop research.

00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:13,921
"Slipped on it.
Smell it but can't find it."

Torn poop bag."

"It's a wet one." [groans] Gross.

What?

928
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:41,300
Bad Luck gravity works the opposite
of ours, remember?

929
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:44,344
Oh, right. [exclaims]

931
00:55:47,681 --> 00:55:50,350
Down to go up, that's just weird.

932
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:52,769
-So, how did you know?
-Know what?

933
00:55:52,853 --> 00:55:54,521
How to get here through Bad Luck?

934
00:55:54,605 --> 00:55:57,482
Well, simple.
Bad Luck is a mirror image of Good Luck.

935
00:55:57,566 --> 00:55:58,567
Oh.

936
00:55:59,401 --> 00:56:02,779
-And this is the In Between?
-Not quite.

937
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:04,239
Come on, give me a hand.

938
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:10,454
This is the In Between.

-[grunts]

941
00:56:20,589 --> 00:56:21,798
Shake it off.

-Ugh, it's Jeff.

[stammers] Forget that! Hide!

944
00:56:27,804 --> 00:56:29,681
He is a total blabbermouth.

945
00:56:29,765 --> 00:56:33,060
If he sees us, we'll never have a chance
to find the penny.

946
00:56:33,644 --> 00:56:35,562
[gasps] Jeff's a unicorn?

947
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:38,482
Ah, warming up the muscles.

00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:40,859
[gasps] Heiliger Strohsack.

949
00:56:41,902 --> 00:56:44,404
Oh, it's like a strasse of bad luck.

950
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:46,949
Hmm. What's happening, guys?

951
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:51,328
-Hello.
-[screams]

952
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:54,665
Oh, you surprise my heart to stop.

953
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:56,166
[gasps]

954
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:02,297
Mighty leprechaun Fräulein!
Okay. Well done, nature.

955
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:03,382
Yep.

956
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,051
Robert, is that you?

957
00:57:06,635 --> 00:57:08,011
Hi, Jeff.

958
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,263
Oh, guten Tag.

959
00:57:09,346 --> 00:57:10,931
So you two are friends?

960
00:57:11,014 --> 00:57:13,433
[chuckles]
Oh, Robert doesn't want friends,

961
00:57:13,517 --> 00:57:17,187
but lucky for him,
I wouldn't take nein for an answer.

962
00:57:17,271 --> 00:57:21,191
Zip, zip, zip and whisk, whisk, whisk.
[scoffs] They are stuck to your shoesy.

963
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:26,697
Sometimes a little goes psst, psst, ja?
From my homemade bad luck apparat.

964
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,866
It's my one-of-a-kind mixer machine

965
00:57:28,949 --> 00:57:32,369
that feeds the bad luck
straight into das Randomizer.

966
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:34,079
[no audible dialogue]

967
00:57:34,162 --> 00:57:36,999
-Will you show me how it works?
-Oh! Ja, komm.

968
00:57:37,082 --> 00:57:41,920
Oh! Es ist sehr exciting to have visitors.
[chuckles] I'm excited. I can't hide it.

969
00:57:42,004 --> 00:57:45,549
Oh, um, I'll catch up. I need to, uh,
find some kitty litter.

970
00:57:45,632 --> 00:57:47,301
[Jeff] Sounds gross, Robert. Bye.

971
00:57:48,427 --> 00:57:51,388
So the thing is,
the bad luck sticks to itself

972
00:57:51,471 --> 00:57:54,016
like the butter of nuts
to the roof of your mouth.

973
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:57,519
So, you're saying bad luck
attracts more bad luck?

974
00:57:57,603 --> 00:57:59,229
-'Cause that would explain a lot.
-Ja.

975
00:57:59,313 --> 00:58:02,733
Like glue. See?
That's what used to happen.

976
00:58:02,816 --> 00:58:07,404
So I made eine mixing machine,
and voilà! No more clogs.

977
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:10,407
The bad luck flows right
to das Randomizer.

978
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:13,327
-That's some top-notch engineering, Jeff.
-Danke schön.

979
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:16,496
Oh, and I no longer go by Jeff.
[clicks tongue]

980
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:20,334
Ja, recently I have reverted
to my birth name, Heimdall!

981
00:58:20,417 --> 00:58:24,213
Heim-dall. Like, you know, the little doll
but first with a "Heim" in front.

982
00:58:24,296 --> 00:58:26,673
Okay, ja, sure, the name fit better
when I was younger.

983
00:58:26,757 --> 00:58:29,009
I get it. You don't have to say it.

984
00:58:29,885 --> 00:58:31,470
Is that the Dragon?

985
00:58:31,553 --> 00:58:34,014
Ja, that's her. Meine one true love.

986
00:58:34,097 --> 00:58:37,601
She smelted me this locket,
and she saved my life.

987
00:58:37,684 --> 00:58:38,977
What happened?

988
00:58:39,061 --> 00:58:44,107
Before my mixing machine, I had to clean
out the bad luck clogs by hand.

989
00:58:44,191 --> 00:58:50,697
And one day the pipe, it plätzen!
And gesprüht bad luck dust all over me.

990
00:58:50,781 --> 00:58:56,161
The Dragon heard and sent for me sofort.
It was love at first look.

991
00:58:56,245 --> 00:58:59,623
She borrowed me a lucky penny
to counteract the bad luck.

992
00:58:59,706 --> 00:59:02,251
But bad luck can really linger.

993
00:59:02,334 --> 00:59:08,173
It took four months to recover, but they
were the beste four months of my life.

994
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:11,009
And then she broke my heart.

995
00:59:11,093 --> 00:59:12,094
Why?

996
00:59:12,177 --> 00:59:15,013
Well, sometimes I would track
a little bad luck into Good Luck

997
00:59:15,097 --> 00:59:16,390
on my shoesies.

998
00:59:16,473 --> 00:59:21,436
She was so terrified of what bad luck
might do to her creatures and her world,

999
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,021
so she broke it off.

1000
00:59:23,105 --> 00:59:24,731
And now we're both alone.

1001
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:26,608
How sad.

1002
00:59:30,487 --> 00:59:32,406
[Jeff]
If I could leave meine work, I would.

1003
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:36,577
But we einhorn have cared for
the Randomizer since the buttocks of dawn.

1004
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:39,830
-[signal blaring]
-Oh, goody! A delivery!

1005
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:48,005
Oh! Da bist du, Robert! [chuckles]

1006
00:59:48,088 --> 00:59:52,301
Guess what? Earlier,
I found a bunny drone in the pile. Mm-hmm.

1007
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:55,012
Ja, just one. Ja, I wanted a set of six.

1008
00:59:55,095 --> 00:59:56,346
Do you still have it?

1009
00:59:58,015 --> 00:59:59,433
Und here she is.

1010
00:59:59,516 --> 01:00:01,727
-Was there a penny?
-Ja, Robert.

1011
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:05,856
But it was so stinky,
so I sent it up to the Penny Depot

1012
01:00:05,939 --> 01:00:09,109
to be disinfected
and put back into circulation.

1013
01:00:11,278 --> 01:00:13,071
[elevator dings, whirs]

1014
01:00:13,155 --> 01:00:16,742
I heard the Captain interrogated poor Edna
for hours about that penny.

1015
01:00:16,825 --> 01:00:18,702
She was clean as a whistle, of course.

1016
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:22,331
So now it's down to just two cats,
Ernie and Bob.

1017
01:00:22,414 --> 01:00:23,832
I'm doomed.

1018
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:29,922
Maybe not. You lay low.
I'm going to see the Dragon.

1019
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:32,633
You can't, Sam.
She'll sniff out your bad luck.

1020
01:00:32,716 --> 01:00:37,513
That's exactly what I want her to do.
And I'm not taking any chances.

1021
01:00:37,596 --> 01:00:39,932
If the Dragon helped an engineer unicorn,

1022
01:00:40,015 --> 01:00:42,309
maybe she'll help
an unlucky leprechaun too.

1023
01:00:42,392 --> 01:00:45,521
If she discovers you're a human,
she'll never let you go home.

1024
01:00:45,604 --> 01:00:47,481
I have to risk it.

1025
01:00:47,564 --> 01:00:50,567
I can't give up on Hazel. Or you, Bob.

1026
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:53,153
Don't go far.

1027
01:00:53,237 --> 01:00:55,614
If I get a penny, we're back in business.

1028
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:04,248
Good afternoon,
I'm here to see the Dragon.

1029
01:01:04,831 --> 01:01:05,666
[intercom beeps]

1030
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:09,670
Leapin' rabbits! It's the tall leprechaun.

1031
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:11,213
Send her in, Hopsberg.

1032
01:01:11,797 --> 01:01:13,549
And the memos too.

1033
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:24,059
Twice in one day.

1034
01:01:24,142 --> 01:01:26,770
You were on the Luck Floor this morning,
right?

1035
01:01:26,854 --> 01:01:28,856
Yes, that was me.

1036
01:01:28,939 --> 01:01:30,315
I thought so.

1037
01:01:30,399 --> 01:01:34,361
Aha. Luck levels looking excellent
as usual.

1038
01:01:36,196 --> 01:01:37,531
See you next week.

1039
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:39,658
Oh, I'm so happy.

1040
01:01:39,741 --> 01:01:43,954
There are so few creatures
here I can actually look in the eye.

1041
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:47,541
We lucky ladies of stature
oughta stick together, don't you think?

1042
01:01:47,624 --> 01:01:48,709
Yeah.

1043
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:52,004
[sniffing] What's this?

1044
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:57,676
[shudders, gasps] Rabbits!

1045
01:01:59,094 --> 01:02:00,721
[retching]

1046
01:02:02,598 --> 01:02:04,892
Under the-- the shoe.

1047
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:07,144
[breathes heavily] Hurry!

1048
01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:09,271
[coughing]

1049
01:02:09,354 --> 01:02:14,151
Oh-- [breathes heavily, coughs]

1050
01:02:17,905 --> 01:02:19,698
[sighs] Much better.

1051
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:26,205
You see, the tiniest amount of bad luck
can shut down our entire operation.

1052
01:02:26,788 --> 01:02:29,791
[sighs] We work so hard to keep it out,
but, you know,

1053
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:35,214
every so often,
bad luck manages to find its way in.

1054
01:02:35,297 --> 01:02:38,717
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean
to upset you. I just--

1055
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,012
It's not you, dear.
Oh, no, no. It's bad luck.

1056
01:02:42,095 --> 01:02:46,016
It's a cruel, corrosive agent of sadness
and destruction that--

1057
01:02:46,099 --> 01:02:49,102
[gasping, sighs]

1058
01:02:49,186 --> 01:02:52,606
I agree. And it explains a lot.

1059
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:55,526
Why it all went haywire
at the Penny Depot for one.

1060
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:57,194
Ah, so that was you.

1061
01:02:57,277 --> 01:03:00,531
Yeah. It's been a bit of a day.

1062
01:03:00,614 --> 01:03:03,075
Oh, poor, innocent leprechaun.

1063
01:03:03,158 --> 01:03:08,914
I'm so sorry you had to go through that.
And you only experienced one speck.

1064
01:03:08,997 --> 01:03:13,085
Think of the poor souls in the Land of
the Unlucky tasked with making the stuff.

1065
01:03:13,168 --> 01:03:19,091
Can you imagine dealing with bad luck
every single day of your life?

1066
01:03:19,716 --> 01:03:23,554
-A truly miserable existence.
-Yeah.

1067
01:03:23,637 --> 01:03:26,807
And I don't suppose it's much fun
for the humans who receive it either.

1068
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:28,308
It isn't.

1069
01:03:28,392 --> 01:03:31,895
I've seen them when I'm out leprechauning.

1070
01:03:32,396 --> 01:03:38,026
These unlucky humans, who,
no matter how hard they try,

1071
01:03:38,777 --> 01:03:44,283
bad luck always shows up just
to beat them down and make them feel so…

1072
01:03:44,366 --> 01:03:46,034
Alone.

1073
01:03:47,035 --> 01:03:48,203
Exactly.

1074
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:52,124
Which is why
we make the good kind of luck,

1075
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:54,751
and as much as we possibly can.

1076
01:03:54,835 --> 01:03:55,919
Yeah.

1077
01:03:56,003 --> 01:03:59,798
'Cause when you have good luck,
it feels like anything is possible.

1078
01:03:59,882 --> 01:04:02,467
-I guess it's because--
-Good luck is joy.

1079
01:04:02,551 --> 01:04:03,552
Yes.

1080
01:04:04,303 --> 01:04:08,682
And hope. It's like you said,
it's the good kind of luck.

1081
01:04:09,433 --> 01:04:15,230
And were I the queen of the universe,
and I suspect it's a job I would excel at,

1082
01:04:15,314 --> 01:04:17,482
I'd rid the world of bad luck altogether!

1083
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:20,819
-[gasps, screams]
-Eradicate it completely.

1084
01:04:20,903 --> 01:04:25,365
Good luck all the time,
what could be better?

1085
01:04:25,449 --> 01:04:26,700
Not a single thing.

1086
01:04:26,783 --> 01:04:29,536
And you can bet
those humans would like it too.

1087
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:33,874
Yeah.
Then their world could look like this.

1088
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:36,001
[chuckles] They should be so lucky.

1089
01:04:36,084 --> 01:04:40,464
You did the right thing coming to see me.
You-- What was your name?

1090
01:04:40,547 --> 01:04:43,050
Oh, Sam. My name is Sam.

1091
01:04:44,092 --> 01:04:46,720
Sam. Call me Babe.

1092
01:04:46,803 --> 01:04:50,641
You know a lot of creatures
are intimidated by tall women, Sam.

1093
01:04:58,273 --> 01:05:02,110
Carry it for a few days. You'll be back
to your lucky self in no time.

1094
01:05:03,612 --> 01:05:07,241
The last creature I helped
needed four months with a penny

1095
01:05:07,324 --> 01:05:09,076
until his bad luck was gone.

1096
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,370
I've heard it can really linger.

1097
01:05:11,954 --> 01:05:14,748
They were the best four months of my life.

1098
01:05:14,831 --> 01:05:17,000
[sighs]

1099
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,461
Thank you, Babe.

1100
01:05:21,964 --> 01:05:24,258
Just return it to the Depot
when you're done.

1101
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:25,676
I will.

1102
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:28,220
[laughs]

1103
01:05:28,303 --> 01:05:32,099
You're about to make
a little girl and a lucky cat so happy.

1104
01:05:32,182 --> 01:05:34,351
[Bob] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy!

1105
01:05:34,434 --> 01:05:37,229
Get off me.
I won't be cat-handled like this.

1106
01:05:37,312 --> 01:05:40,023
We traced the missing penny
back to you, Bob.

1107
01:05:40,107 --> 01:05:41,400
You have no proof.

1108
01:05:41,483 --> 01:05:43,443
This button is all the proof we need.

1109
01:05:43,527 --> 01:05:45,904
It's got your polydactyl paw prints
all over it.

1110
01:05:45,988 --> 01:05:48,282
-[Bob stammers] I can explain.
-It's too late.

1111
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:51,076
You'll be banished
to Bad Luck where you belong.

1112
01:05:59,209 --> 01:06:01,378
[grunting]

1113
01:06:02,421 --> 01:06:03,422
[grunts]

1114
01:06:08,468 --> 01:06:11,972
Obstructing justice?
I oughta arrest you too.

1115
01:06:12,055 --> 01:06:14,766
I was just catching up to Bob
to give him this.

1116
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:16,560
You got it.

1117
01:06:16,643 --> 01:06:18,687
Yes, Bob. I did.

1118
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:21,231
Must've fallen right out of his collar.

1119
01:06:22,482 --> 01:06:25,652
Maybe when you stopped
to try that tasty meat bread.

1120
01:06:25,736 --> 01:06:28,864
And you're absolutely sure
this one is mine?

1121
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:30,616
I'm sure.

1122
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:33,744
[chuckles]
She's a real lifesaver, this one.

1123
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:37,623
[grumbling] If you had your travel penny,
why did you turn in the button, Bob?

1124
01:06:37,706 --> 01:06:41,084
Silly mistake.
I just threw the wrong one into the drop.

1125
01:06:41,168 --> 01:06:42,503
When I discovered the mix-up,

1126
01:06:42,586 --> 01:06:45,339
I was heading
straight back to Decon to turn it in,

1127
01:06:45,422 --> 01:06:49,009
and then I guess that's
when the little bugger just slipped out.

1128
01:06:49,092 --> 01:06:51,845
[chuckles]
Just like that, no travel penny.

1129
01:06:51,929 --> 01:06:52,763
You know,

1130
01:06:52,846 --> 01:06:58,268
I'm starting to think that maybe the
equipment rabbits issued me a bum collar.

1131
01:06:58,352 --> 01:07:00,604
This isn't the first time
it's got loose, you know.

1132
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:02,064
Oh, I see. I see.

1133
01:07:02,147 --> 01:07:06,610
Well, faulty equipment is unacceptable,
Bob. You're right.

1134
01:07:06,693 --> 01:07:08,946
Aye, it most certainly is.

1135
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:10,364
Here you go, Captain.

1136
01:07:14,618 --> 01:07:18,956
I can't believe you just did that.
I mean, thank you, like, a lot,

1137
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:22,125
but you could've taken that penny
straight to your friend Hazel.

1138
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:25,045
Her first, then me, that was the deal.

1139
01:07:25,128 --> 01:07:29,132
I could never let you be sent to Bad Luck
so that Hazel could have good luck.

1140
01:07:29,216 --> 01:07:31,844
-It doesn't work like that.
-[Bob] Well, how does it work?

1141
01:07:31,927 --> 01:07:35,514
Because I don't want you to go home
and leave me here feeling guilty

1142
01:07:35,597 --> 01:07:37,808
that she doesn't get
to use a lucky penny now.

1143
01:07:37,891 --> 01:07:39,601
You think I'm going home?

1144
01:07:39,685 --> 01:07:41,186
Wait. You're not?

1145
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:43,355
I came here to help Hazel,

1146
01:07:43,438 --> 01:07:46,525
and I only have one hour left to do it
before her visit.

1147
01:07:46,608 --> 01:07:49,444
If you're actually feeling guilty,
then you can help me.

1148
01:07:49,528 --> 01:07:52,656
But there's no way to get another penny.

1149
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:55,242
For what we're doing,
we won't need a penny.

1150
01:07:55,951 --> 01:07:57,160
What are we gonna do?

1151
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:00,497
[Sam] We're gonna turn off bad luck.

1152
01:08:00,581 --> 01:08:02,332
If we shut down Jeff's mixer machine,

1153
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:05,460
the bad luck should stick to itself
and clog up the pipe

1154
01:08:05,544 --> 01:08:07,296
so it can't travel to the Randomizer.

1155
01:08:07,379 --> 01:08:10,924
And if no bad luck gets to the Randomizer…

1156
01:08:11,008 --> 01:08:13,427
[Sam] No bad luck gets to the human world.

1157
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:15,095
Wait. What about Jeff?

1158
01:08:15,179 --> 01:08:18,640
Und schneller. Und schneller.
Und steil. Ja, steil.

1159
01:08:18,724 --> 01:08:20,309
Go down that berg.

1160
01:08:21,435 --> 01:08:23,478
I have no words.

1161
01:08:23,562 --> 01:08:26,231
Yeah, I think we're good for a bit.

1162
01:08:27,816 --> 01:08:30,402
You know we can't do this permanently,
right?

1163
01:08:30,484 --> 01:08:33,113
Of course not. That's where you come in.

1164
01:08:33,197 --> 01:08:35,240
I'm gonna turn it back on.

1165
01:08:35,323 --> 01:08:37,451
All Hazel needs is two hours tops.

1166
01:08:37,533 --> 01:08:39,828
And then I flip the switch. And that's it.

1167
01:08:39,912 --> 01:08:44,541
We're even. Fini, complet.
Case closed. Deal done.

1168
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:46,542
You'll never see my face again.

1169
01:08:47,502 --> 01:08:49,630
Great. Here goes.

1170
01:08:57,804 --> 01:08:59,680
[Bob] Look at that.

1171
01:09:01,099 --> 01:09:02,475
It's starting to stick.

1172
01:09:08,273 --> 01:09:09,274
[Sam] It's working.

1173
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:11,693
I wish I could see Hazel.

1174
01:09:11,777 --> 01:09:13,612
I think I can handle that.

1175
01:09:13,694 --> 01:09:16,948
Really?
She lives two miles east of the café.

1176
01:09:17,032 --> 01:09:19,618
Tell me again
why she needs good luck so badly.

1177
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:23,037
If her visit goes well,
she could find her forever family.

1178
01:09:23,121 --> 01:09:24,706
Which is what exactly?

1179
01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:28,502
It's the people who are always there
for you, no matter what happens.

1180
01:09:29,086 --> 01:09:32,130
The ones who don't leave, they stick.

1181
01:09:35,341 --> 01:09:36,426
[Sam gasps] There.

1182
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:38,511
-[Bob] Is that her?
-[Sam] Yeah.

1183
01:09:38,595 --> 01:09:42,057
It looks like the couple will be there
any minute. It's all I hoped for,

1184
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:45,644
a little good luck for Hazel,
and we did it, Bob.

1185
01:09:45,727 --> 01:09:47,604
I swear I could hug you right now.

1186
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:49,689
Cats aren't really huggers.

1187
01:09:49,773 --> 01:09:51,899
Well, I love hugs.

1188
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:59,116
[sighs] So, that's it then.
Deal finally done.

1189
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:00,784
Please thank Gerry for me.

1190
01:10:00,868 --> 01:10:03,495
And I'm sorry I stretched out his clothes.

1191
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:07,666
Hey, Sam. I'm curious.
What do you hope for now?

1192
01:10:07,749 --> 01:10:09,626
Are you asking me questions, Bob?

1193
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:11,128
Now that you're finally leaving,

1194
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:13,172
it seemed like a good time
to get to know you better.

1195
01:10:13,255 --> 01:10:14,715
[chuckles] In that case,

1196
01:10:14,798 --> 01:10:18,093
I guess I just hope
I can do something good with my life.

1197
01:10:18,177 --> 01:10:20,846
That my bad luck won't
get in the way, you know?

1198
01:10:20,929 --> 01:10:23,599
Aye. I think I do.

1199
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:27,561
Right. Well, that's us.

1200
01:10:31,273 --> 01:10:34,109
-[gasps]
-[rumbling, whirring]

1201
01:10:34,193 --> 01:10:35,194
[Sam] Huh?

1202
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:40,115
It's coming from the In Between.
There must be something wrong.

1203
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:41,700
[sighs]

1204
01:10:44,745 --> 01:10:46,580
[whirring]

1205
01:10:48,707 --> 01:10:49,708
[screams]

1206
01:11:06,517 --> 01:11:08,018
-[glass shatters]
-[both yelp]

1207
01:11:21,323 --> 01:11:23,116
[screaming]

1208
01:11:34,878 --> 01:11:36,964
I didn't think that was possible.

1209
01:11:37,047 --> 01:11:38,924
Oh, no. Hazel!

1210
01:11:51,144 --> 01:11:52,813
Hazel. No.

1211
01:11:55,023 --> 01:11:56,024
No. [gasps]

1212
01:11:57,568 --> 01:11:58,819
[gasps, pants]

1213
01:12:03,949 --> 01:12:05,450
[cracking]

1214
01:12:05,951 --> 01:12:08,662
[gasps] The good luck stone!

1215
01:12:08,745 --> 01:12:12,416
Oh, this can't be happening.
I need good luck to forge a new one.

1216
01:12:12,499 --> 01:12:15,669
The clovers are shriveled.
The pigs cannot create good luck.

1217
01:12:18,922 --> 01:12:20,549
[pants] What about the pennies?

1218
01:12:22,759 --> 01:12:24,761
[coins clinking]

1219
01:12:24,845 --> 01:12:27,306
Just one lucky penny would be enough.

1220
01:12:27,931 --> 01:12:30,100
They're all contaminated!

1221
01:12:30,184 --> 01:12:31,518
Try this one.

1222
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:35,230
Is it lucky or not?

1223
01:12:38,775 --> 01:12:39,985
Not.

1224
01:12:41,695 --> 01:12:44,364
Wait. Why do you have that, boss?

1225
01:12:44,448 --> 01:12:47,367
Does this mean you're not lucky?

1226
01:12:48,994 --> 01:12:51,038
I was right all along.

1227
01:12:51,121 --> 01:12:54,333
You're a liar and a thief.
I bet you're not even Scottish.

1228
01:12:55,792 --> 01:12:57,294
I'm not.

1229
01:12:57,377 --> 01:12:58,879
I'm English, actually.

1230
01:12:59,838 --> 01:13:03,258
And I lived eight lives in bad luck
before I found that penny.

1231
01:13:04,051 --> 01:13:06,512
It was the penny that made you lucky.

1232
01:13:06,595 --> 01:13:07,721
Yes.

1233
01:13:08,639 --> 01:13:10,474
I'm a bad luck black cat.

1234
01:13:11,183 --> 01:13:12,392
And I always will be.

1235
01:13:12,476 --> 01:13:13,810
-[crashing]
-[gasps]

1236
01:13:17,523 --> 01:13:20,108
[shattering]

1237
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:36,542
[Sam] What does that mean?

1238
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:40,671
The connection between the human world
and the luck world

1239
01:13:40,754 --> 01:13:43,215
has been severed for good.

1240
01:13:43,298 --> 01:13:46,426
[Sam] But there must be a way to fix it!
To reconnect.

1241
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:50,138
Without good luck, there is no way.

1242
01:13:50,222 --> 01:13:53,433
But I have to get to Hazel!
I have to go home.

1243
01:13:56,562 --> 01:13:58,730
You're a human?

1244
01:14:00,774 --> 01:14:04,653
Yes. And I have to go home.

1245
01:14:04,736 --> 01:14:08,031
[scoffs] And what about our home, Sam?

1246
01:14:09,408 --> 01:14:14,371
We exist to make luck for your world.
What will happen to us now?

1247
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:22,963
You should never have come here.

1248
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:26,008
She was only following me.

1249
01:14:26,091 --> 01:14:29,136
I'm so sorry.
I never meant for any of this.

1250
01:14:29,219 --> 01:14:32,431
I was just trying to help my friend.

1251
01:14:32,514 --> 01:14:35,058
[scoffs] And instead,
you've made sure that she

1252
01:14:35,142 --> 01:14:38,937
and no other humans
will ever experience luck again.

1253
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:45,444
We should just banish both
of them to Bad Luck.

1254
01:14:46,069 --> 01:14:49,823
Oh, what does it matter?
It's all bad luck now.

1255
01:14:52,284 --> 01:14:55,370
See, I knew there was something
off about you, Bob.

1256
01:14:55,454 --> 01:14:58,123
I knew it deep in my soul.

1257
01:14:58,207 --> 01:15:00,501
Only, I didn't stop you in time.

1258
01:15:00,584 --> 01:15:03,587
And I have to live
with that for the rest of my life.

1259
01:15:19,478 --> 01:15:21,396
I should've been better, Sam.

1260
01:15:23,273 --> 01:15:25,901
I should've given you the penny
for your friend.

1261
01:15:27,361 --> 01:15:30,364
If I had, none of this would've happened.

1262
01:15:31,865 --> 01:15:37,037
[Sam] But you were afraid I'd lose it
or flush it down another toilet.

1263
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:40,207
I was afraid to lose my lucky life.

1264
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:42,668
And too selfish to risk it.

1265
01:15:43,293 --> 01:15:45,295
Well, you made the right choice.

1266
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:48,757
-I make things worse. It's what I do.
-Sam--

1267
01:15:48,841 --> 01:15:51,552
You'd think
I would have learned my lesson by now.

1268
01:15:51,635 --> 01:15:53,303
To just lay down for once,

1269
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:57,057
stop trying so hard,
stop sweating, like you said.

1270
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:58,725
I should never have said that.

1271
01:15:58,809 --> 01:16:00,435
It's true.

1272
01:16:00,519 --> 01:16:04,189
Even here, in the luckiest place
in the universe,

1273
01:16:04,273 --> 01:16:07,484
I still found a way to screw it all up.

1274
01:16:07,568 --> 01:16:10,404
[sighs] And that's how I know.

1275
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:11,822
Know what?

1276
01:16:11,905 --> 01:16:17,452
That it's not my bad luck
that's the problem. It's just me.

1277
01:16:19,329 --> 01:16:22,541
And there's no amount of good luck
that can ever fix it.

1278
01:16:22,624 --> 01:16:24,501
I don't believe that.

1279
01:16:24,585 --> 01:16:26,128
Well you should.

1280
01:16:26,211 --> 01:16:29,464
Not only did I doom Hazel, and you, and--

1281
01:16:29,548 --> 01:16:33,927
and everyone else to a life of bad luck,
but now I can't get back to her.

1282
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:37,306
I'm just another adult
who broke another promise.

1283
01:16:37,931 --> 01:16:40,851
The kind that leaves and doesn't stick.

1284
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:46,190
I swear,
she'd be better off if she never met me.

1285
01:16:48,734 --> 01:16:50,444
Well, I wouldn't be better off.

1286
01:16:51,153 --> 01:16:52,779
You're not bad, Sam.

1287
01:16:53,697 --> 01:16:55,282
You're the opposite of bad,

1288
01:16:55,866 --> 01:17:00,245
like some kind of pure goodness
I didn't think was possible for a human.

1289
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:05,250
Your first instinct is to share,
like the tasty meat bread.

1290
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:09,505
Or to help, even if helping might stop you
from getting what you want the most.

1291
01:17:09,588 --> 01:17:14,551
And what's crazier is what you want
the most isn't even for you.

1292
01:17:15,219 --> 01:17:18,639
You want good things for others in a way
that I can't comprehend,

1293
01:17:18,722 --> 01:17:22,476
and you'll endure the worst bad luck ever
to make it happen.

1294
01:17:24,144 --> 01:17:28,190
I was wrong to ever tell you not
to try because every time you do,

1295
01:17:28,273 --> 01:17:31,693
you make things better.
And that's how I know.

1296
01:17:32,778 --> 01:17:34,404
Know what?

1297
01:17:34,488 --> 01:17:37,783
That your friend Hazel
doesn't need good luck.

1298
01:17:37,866 --> 01:17:41,620
She's already the luckiest girl
in the world 'cause she has you.

1299
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:46,291
You said you wanted
to do something good with your life.

1300
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:48,919
You already have.

1301
01:17:51,547 --> 01:17:53,632
[crying]

1302
01:17:56,844 --> 01:17:58,637
[whimpers]

1303
01:18:03,308 --> 01:18:05,310
I didn't mean to make you cry.

1304
01:18:06,186 --> 01:18:09,273
Don't worry, Bob. It's a happy cry.

1305
01:18:10,148 --> 01:18:13,569
Humans are so weird.

1306
01:18:13,652 --> 01:18:15,988
[laughs]

1307
01:18:16,947 --> 01:18:18,782
[inhales deeply, sighs]

1308
01:18:19,366 --> 01:18:21,410
There's gotta be a way to fix this!

1309
01:18:21,493 --> 01:18:23,954
Yes, and get you back to Hazel.

1310
01:18:24,037 --> 01:18:26,790
[inhales sharply]
But fat chance of that happening.

1311
01:18:26,874 --> 01:18:29,418
Unless you have some good luck hidden
in there, which, uh--

1312
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:31,128
Wait. What did you say?

1313
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,089
"Unless you have some good luck hidden
in there"?

1314
01:18:34,173 --> 01:18:36,091
-That's it.
-What is?

1315
01:18:36,175 --> 01:18:38,135
There's good luck down in Bad Luck.

1316
01:18:38,218 --> 01:18:39,845
How do you know that?

1317
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:41,221
Because I've seen it!

1318
01:18:41,305 --> 01:18:45,017
And you're planning to go right back
down to Bad Luck and fetch it?

1319
01:18:45,601 --> 01:18:47,811
-That's your plan?
-Bingo.

1320
01:18:51,231 --> 01:18:53,108
-[grunts]
-Welcome back to the Land of Bad Luck.

1321
01:18:53,192 --> 01:18:55,235
Oh, it's like I never left.

1322
01:18:56,111 --> 01:18:57,112
[groans]

1323
01:18:57,196 --> 01:19:01,325
The good luck is somewhere
between here in Dog Poop and the elevator.

1324
01:19:01,825 --> 01:19:03,994
Okay, describe what you saw exactly.

1325
01:19:04,077 --> 01:19:07,873
Monsters were gathered around
this green light that had to be good luck.

1326
01:19:07,956 --> 01:19:09,291
And then a bell would ding,

1327
01:19:09,374 --> 01:19:11,919
and they'd start shouting,
and there was fire and--

1328
01:19:12,002 --> 01:19:14,087
-Fire?
-Yeah.

1329
01:19:14,171 --> 01:19:16,215
It could only be one place.

1330
01:19:19,885 --> 01:19:22,304
I must have come
in the back door last time.

1331
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:24,306
[door thuds, creaks]

1332
01:19:24,973 --> 01:19:26,683
Wait! Don't go in yet!

1333
01:19:26,767 --> 01:19:28,560
[monsters chattering]

1334
01:19:31,021 --> 01:19:32,105
Bob.

1335
01:19:32,189 --> 01:19:35,192
-[gasps]
-[monsters growling]

1336
01:19:35,275 --> 01:19:36,610
[gasps, whimpers]

1337
01:19:36,693 --> 01:19:37,736
-Hi.
-[screams]

1338
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,535
Oh, this is it.

1339
01:19:47,079 --> 01:19:49,665
Bob? Oh, is that you?

1340
01:19:49,748 --> 01:19:51,792
Where the heck you been, brother?

1341
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:53,710
Hey, Rootie, how's it going?

1342
01:19:53,794 --> 01:19:56,129
-[patron 1] It's Bob.
-[patron 2] Long time, no see.

1343
01:19:56,213 --> 01:19:59,258
-Monsters, huh?
-You said monsters.

1344
01:19:59,341 --> 01:20:02,427
I said roots and goblins, which they are.

1345
01:20:02,511 --> 01:20:03,720
[bleating] Hey, Bob.

1346
01:20:04,388 --> 01:20:06,723
-Oh, and goats.
-How do they know you?

1347
01:20:06,807 --> 01:20:09,393
Oh, I, uh, spent a couple of hours here.

1348
01:20:09,476 --> 01:20:11,562
Yeah, try eight lifetimes.

1349
01:20:11,645 --> 01:20:15,315
Just sitting here sipping
my famous tangerine tornado

1350
01:20:15,399 --> 01:20:18,652
and talking about how if he could
just find a little good luck,

1351
01:20:18,735 --> 01:20:20,362
he could finally be happy.

1352
01:20:20,445 --> 01:20:22,322
Oh, we thought you were dead, Bob.

1353
01:20:22,406 --> 01:20:25,367
Yeah, Rootie even retired your barstool.

1354
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:28,829
Wow, that's-- Thanks.

1355
01:20:28,912 --> 01:20:31,290
But, uh, yeah, not dead. [chuckles]

1356
01:20:31,373 --> 01:20:34,209
Just looking for a little good luck,
like Rootie said.

1357
01:20:34,293 --> 01:20:36,128
Aw, where are my manners?

1358
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:39,381
I'm Rootie, the proprietor
of this tropical juice bar

1359
01:20:39,464 --> 01:20:42,676
and the self-appointed mayor of Bad Luck.

1360
01:20:42,759 --> 01:20:44,136
[imitates trumpet]

1361
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:46,388
Nice to meet you, Rootie. I'm Sam.

1362
01:20:46,471 --> 01:20:49,892
Hey, you're that leprechaun
who broke the elevator.

1363
01:20:49,975 --> 01:20:52,811
Human actually, and yeah.
Sorry about that.

1364
01:20:52,895 --> 01:20:55,898
Human, huh? Well, that's a first.

1365
01:20:55,981 --> 01:20:58,650
Hey, Bob.
We'll get your stool down for ya.

1366
01:20:58,734 --> 01:21:00,402
[grunting]

1367
01:21:00,485 --> 01:21:03,155
-[patrons exclaim]
-[exclaims] Duct tape, flying in!

1368
01:21:03,906 --> 01:21:06,533
Oh, don't worry about it, guys.
We-- We can't stick around.

1369
01:21:06,617 --> 01:21:09,077
-We need your help.
-Name it. What's going on?

1370
01:21:09,161 --> 01:21:12,247
Well, the luck lines have detached,
the Randomizer is broken,

1371
01:21:12,331 --> 01:21:15,250
and we're floating off into the void
with no real purpose to exist.

1372
01:21:15,334 --> 01:21:17,586
We thought we just short-circuited a wire.

1373
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:19,963
We didn't realize we had broken
the whole world.

1374
01:21:20,047 --> 01:21:21,798
Oh, it wasn't you guys. It was us.

1375
01:21:21,882 --> 01:21:25,010
Something broke, and it wasn't our fault?
Amen, brother.

1376
01:21:25,093 --> 01:21:26,470
[both cheer, laugh]

1377
01:21:26,553 --> 01:21:28,180
But there might still be a way to fix it.

1378
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:30,724
When I was here before,
I saw a green light,

1379
01:21:30,807 --> 01:21:33,185
which I'm really hoping is good luck.

1380
01:21:33,268 --> 01:21:36,355
Oh, yeah, we've got some.
It's in the Lucky Shot.

1381
01:21:37,022 --> 01:21:38,023
[both] Lucky Shot?

1382
01:21:38,106 --> 01:21:40,067
-[chattering]
-[ball dribbling]

1383
01:21:41,026 --> 01:21:42,986
-[grunting]
-[all exclaiming]

1384
01:21:44,696 --> 01:21:46,073
-[cheering]
-[bell dings]

1385
01:21:46,156 --> 01:21:48,408
-[Rootie] Yeah! Way to go, Stinky!
-[chanting]

1386
01:21:48,909 --> 01:21:50,327
All right, follow me.

1387
01:21:52,371 --> 01:21:53,747
Happened after you left, Bob.

1388
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:57,167
I was out fixing cracks
when I backed into this pipe

1389
01:21:57,251 --> 01:21:59,211
and a little good luck floated out.

1390
01:21:59,878 --> 01:22:03,966
So I gathered it up and dropped it
straight into the Lucky Shot.

1391
01:22:04,049 --> 01:22:07,052
Figured that way everybody
could experience a little good luck.

1392
01:22:07,135 --> 01:22:09,429
-You know what I mean?
-But what about them?

1393
01:22:09,513 --> 01:22:10,639
Oh, you're kidding?

1394
01:22:10,722 --> 01:22:13,892
[chuckles] They'll just find
something else to rally around.

1395
01:22:13,976 --> 01:22:17,062
It's one of the benefits of bad luck.
It teaches you to pivot.

1396
01:22:17,145 --> 01:22:19,439
I never really thought about it that way.

1397
01:22:20,774 --> 01:22:23,360
[all grumbling]

1398
01:22:23,443 --> 01:22:25,946
-[patron 1] Come on!
-[patron 2] Something must be broken.

1399
01:22:26,029 --> 01:22:27,573
-[patron 3] Bummer.
-Huh.

1400
01:22:28,532 --> 01:22:30,868
Okay. Frisbee golf, anyone?

1401
01:22:30,951 --> 01:22:32,327
See what I'm saying?

1402
01:22:32,411 --> 01:22:34,246
And once you've fixed the Randomizer,

1403
01:22:34,329 --> 01:22:37,165
I have no doubt, one day,
I'll find some more.

1404
01:22:37,791 --> 01:22:41,378
Thank you, Rootie.
Oh, and we'll need some bad luck dust too.

1405
01:22:41,461 --> 01:22:43,755
Oh, have at it. Plenty of that around.

1406
01:22:43,839 --> 01:22:46,550
And if you could use our help up there,
just say the word.

1407
01:22:46,633 --> 01:22:47,676
Word.

1408
01:22:47,759 --> 01:22:49,553
[chuckling] Well, giddy up!

1409
01:22:49,636 --> 01:22:51,638
We gotta get this to the Dragon.

1410
01:22:51,722 --> 01:22:55,392
She won't be happy to see us.
We just wrecked her world.

1411
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:59,229
I think we know someone
she will be happy to see.

1412
01:22:59,813 --> 01:23:03,358
[Babe cries, blows nose]

1413
01:23:03,442 --> 01:23:04,443
[cries]

1414
01:23:07,196 --> 01:23:10,032
How could I miss that she was a human?

1415
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:12,993
Oh, a tall leprechaun? Ha!

1416
01:23:13,076 --> 01:23:15,037
How dare they show up here?

1417
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,580
[Babe] Who is it?

1418
01:23:16,663 --> 01:23:20,375
It's Bob, the girl and a unicorn.

1419
01:23:20,459 --> 01:23:21,668
Jeff?

1420
01:23:22,419 --> 01:23:27,841
[grunting, sighing] Guter Kummer,
I don't remember it being that tough.

1421
01:23:27,925 --> 01:23:30,093
Of course, last time I was a stallion.

1422
01:23:30,177 --> 01:23:32,554
It has been a hundred years.

1423
01:23:34,097 --> 01:23:37,809
[blusters] Schön dich zu sehen, Babe.

1424
01:23:37,893 --> 01:23:39,561
Heimdall.

1425
01:23:40,354 --> 01:23:42,856
[sighs] You got a lot of nerve
coming here.

1426
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:44,608
Hear them out, Babe.

1427
01:23:44,691 --> 01:23:48,529
A little good luck.
It might be enough to fix the Randomizer.

1428
01:23:48,612 --> 01:23:49,780
Where did it come from?

1429
01:23:49,863 --> 01:23:51,114
Bad Luck.

1430
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:55,369
Somehow it made its way down there,
and they were kind enough to share.

1431
01:23:55,452 --> 01:23:58,080
We need you to forge two new stones.

1432
01:23:58,163 --> 01:23:59,831
Just like when you made this.

1433
01:24:00,541 --> 01:24:03,085
[gasps] You still have it.

1434
01:24:03,168 --> 01:24:04,628
I never took it off.

1435
01:24:05,295 --> 01:24:06,755
[puffs]

1436
01:24:06,839 --> 01:24:10,092
Your ancient dragon flames
have the power, Babe.

1437
01:24:10,175 --> 01:24:12,928
I trust you remember how
to wield your burning hot Feuer?

1438
01:24:13,011 --> 01:24:14,930
Was that a dare?

1439
01:24:15,013 --> 01:24:16,849
[whinnies]

1440
01:24:22,229 --> 01:24:24,439
Let's see if I've still got it.

1441
01:24:28,819 --> 01:24:30,612
[inhales sharply]

1442
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:45,043
[stammering] Was ist das?

1443
01:24:45,127 --> 01:24:47,588
You said you needed two stones. Voilà!

1444
01:24:47,671 --> 01:24:49,548
But you made three.

1445
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:51,675
Oh, the bad luck stone was just a warm-up.

1446
01:24:51,758 --> 01:24:54,845
And these are for the Randomizer.

1447
01:24:54,928 --> 01:24:57,431
Have you lost your brain marbles, Babe?

1448
01:24:57,514 --> 01:25:00,559
Because you know very well
that das Randomizer needs a good luck

1449
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:02,019
and a bad luck stone.

1450
01:25:02,102 --> 01:25:05,522
Does it though? Two stones, sure.

1451
01:25:05,606 --> 01:25:07,941
But show me where it says
they can't both be lucky.

1452
01:25:08,734 --> 01:25:11,236
This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

1453
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:15,157
[gasps] With these two stones,
we can eliminate bad luck

1454
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:19,161
and all that goes with it.
The frustration, the loneliness, the--

1455
01:25:19,244 --> 01:25:21,747
-Wait. But--
-You said it yourself, Sam.

1456
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:25,209
Without bad luck,
your world could look just like ours.

1457
01:25:26,418 --> 01:25:27,961
Toodle-oo!

1458
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:47,022
[whirring]

1459
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:55,614
Down to go up.

1460
01:26:09,628 --> 01:26:11,046
[pants]

1461
01:26:11,129 --> 01:26:12,130
[pants]

1462
01:26:12,214 --> 01:26:14,675
I can't let you
place two good luck stones.

1463
01:26:14,758 --> 01:26:18,595
Nonsense.
Good luck for everyone all the time.

1464
01:26:18,679 --> 01:26:21,056
We can make that happen, Sam.

1465
01:26:21,139 --> 01:26:23,642
You, of all people, should want that.

1466
01:26:23,725 --> 01:26:27,563
I know bad luck can be terrible,
especially when it keeps coming.

1467
01:26:27,646 --> 01:26:31,024
-But we still need it.
-[scoffs] Need it?

1468
01:26:31,108 --> 01:26:35,028
The only thing bad luck ever did for me
was break my world and break my heart.

1469
01:26:35,612 --> 01:26:37,948
No. It was me who broke your world.

1470
01:26:39,449 --> 01:26:43,036
It's Bad Luck that's here
helping put it back together.

1471
01:26:43,871 --> 01:26:46,498
-Hey, these things happen.
-Not here.

1472
01:26:46,582 --> 01:26:49,042
-Oh, there we go.
-Don't worry.

1473
01:26:54,298 --> 01:26:57,009
I know you're afraid to let bad luck in.

1474
01:26:57,092 --> 01:27:00,888
You think it's the reason you're alone.
I did too.

1475
01:27:00,971 --> 01:27:04,433
I blamed bad luck for everything
that went wrong in my life.

1476
01:27:04,516 --> 01:27:09,605
But coming here, I realized that
it also made some things go very right.

1477
01:27:09,688 --> 01:27:14,067
Without my bad luck,
I wouldn't have met Hazel or Bob.

1478
01:27:15,819 --> 01:27:18,822
And you would've never met
the love of your life.

1479
01:27:18,906 --> 01:27:20,199
What are you talking about?

1480
01:27:20,282 --> 01:27:23,994
You only met Jeff
because he'd been doused by bad luck.

1481
01:27:24,077 --> 01:27:26,205
Which means, it didn't tear you apart.

1482
01:27:26,288 --> 01:27:28,749
Bad luck brought you together
in the first place.

1483
01:27:30,792 --> 01:27:33,170
You think your creatures
can't endure bad luck,

1484
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,257
but they can, and they will.

1485
01:27:46,892 --> 01:27:48,435
And so can you.

1486
01:27:48,519 --> 01:27:52,648
You don't have to fear bad luck
because you have each other.

1487
01:27:54,358 --> 01:27:57,569
And that makes you
the luckiest creatures I know.

1488
01:28:01,949 --> 01:28:05,953
Why, if-- if good and bad luck can
at long last live side by side,

1489
01:28:06,954 --> 01:28:08,830
then I would love nothing more.

1490
01:28:09,831 --> 01:28:12,668
Far be it from me
to take all the mystery out of life.

1491
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:14,461
Both it is.

1492
01:28:20,801 --> 01:28:22,344
[screams]

1493
01:28:22,427 --> 01:28:23,262
Sam!

1494
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:28,100

1495
01:28:31,854 --> 01:28:32,855

[Sam yelps]

1498
01:28:45,576 --> 01:28:49,454
We lucky ladies of stature
oughta stick together, don't you think?

1499
01:28:49,538 --> 01:28:50,581
Oh, yes.

1500
01:28:56,503 --> 01:28:57,713
Thank you, Sam.

1501
01:28:59,047 --> 01:29:02,050

1502

1506
01:30:28,887 --> 01:30:32,474
[Rootie] All right!
One bad-break banana banshee coming down.

1507
01:30:34,059 --> 01:30:35,936
-[chuckles] Sorry, Root.
-[glass shatters]

1508
01:30:36,019 --> 01:30:40,482
No problem, Fred.
You know I always make two, just in case.

1509
01:30:40,566 --> 01:30:42,150
-[banging]
-[bleating] What was that?

1510

[door thuds, creaks]

1511
01:30:46,238 --> 01:30:47,489
Knock, knock.

1512
01:30:47,573 --> 01:30:49,741
[creatures exclaiming]

1513
01:30:49,825 --> 01:30:51,618
We miss you already.

1514
01:30:51,702 --> 01:30:53,537
-"We"?
-[patron 4] Sam!

1515
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:56,790
-[laughs] Sam. Bob.
-Hey, Rootie.

1516
01:30:56,874 --> 01:30:59,251
-[Rootie] Good Luck in Bad Luck.
-Oh, and Hairy Lemon.

1517
01:30:59,334 --> 01:31:02,087
Now, this is a good-looking juice bar.

1518
01:31:02,171 --> 01:31:05,340
[chuckles] Yeah. First tropical juice bar
in the Land of Luck.

1519
01:31:05,424 --> 01:31:09,178
We come bearing gifts.
Or, well, gift rather.

1520
01:31:09,261 --> 01:31:10,971
It's for the Lucky Shot.

1521
01:31:11,054 --> 01:31:12,639
[patrons gasping]

1522
01:31:12,723 --> 01:31:15,309
She sure is a beauty.

1523
01:31:15,392 --> 01:31:18,770
Oh, it's a small token of thanks
for coming to our aid.

1524
01:31:18,854 --> 01:31:20,772
It was our pleasure, Ms. The Dragon.

1525
01:31:20,856 --> 01:31:23,817
And we sure do appreciate you dropping
in for a visit.

1526
01:31:23,901 --> 01:31:25,986
I should have come long ago.

1527
01:31:26,069 --> 01:31:30,908
Und we have our unlucky Freund Sam
to thank for bringing us all together.

1528
01:31:30,991 --> 01:31:32,492
Way to go, Latvia!

1529
01:31:32,576 --> 01:31:35,287
[both chanting] Latvia! Latvia!

1530
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:38,248
[all chanting] Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam!

1531
01:31:38,332 --> 01:31:40,125
Speaking of my bad luck,

1532
01:31:40,209 --> 01:31:44,588
I'd like to thank you guys
for sending it all my way.

1533
01:31:44,671 --> 01:31:49,635
The flat tires, the toast jam-side-down,
the keys in the sewer.

1534
01:31:49,718 --> 01:31:52,137
-Hey, that was me!
-[laughing]

1535
01:31:52,221 --> 01:31:58,310
It wasn't all fun,
but I wouldn't change a single thing.

1536
01:31:58,894 --> 01:32:01,438
Fire her up. What do you say, Sam?

1537
01:32:02,523 --> 01:32:06,860
[patrons gasping, cheering]

1538
01:32:06,944 --> 01:32:09,821
-Take a shot, Bob.
-[patron 5] Come on, Bob!

1539
01:32:09,905 --> 01:32:12,699
[patrons laughing, gasping]

1540
01:32:14,576 --> 01:32:16,703
-[all cheering]
-[bell dinging]

1541
01:32:16,787 --> 01:32:18,956
[chanting, cheering]

1542
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:23,418
Hey! So, what do you say, Bob?
Ready to come home?

1543
01:32:23,502 --> 01:32:25,587
Sounds like the guys
got your barstool fixed

1544
01:32:25,671 --> 01:32:27,506
and ready for your little cat butt.

1545
01:32:27,589 --> 01:32:29,466
[chuckles] Thanks, guys.

1546
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:32,135
Well, we were actually hoping
Bob might stay in Good Luck.

1547
01:32:32,219 --> 01:32:33,804
The Captain said
you could have your job back.

1548
01:32:33,887 --> 01:32:39,101
Yeah, despite your growing rap sheet,
Gerry claims you're a good line cat.

1549
01:32:39,184 --> 01:32:40,811
So, come on back.

1550
01:32:40,894 --> 01:32:45,190
Oh, and we made you this,
your very own lucky penny.

1551
01:32:46,108 --> 01:32:47,109
Wow.

1552
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:51,280
A lucky life
just like you always wanted, Bob.

1553
01:32:51,363 --> 01:32:52,656
I'm so happy for you.

1554
01:32:54,116 --> 01:32:55,659
Good for you, Bob.

1555
01:32:57,494 --> 01:33:00,914
Thanks, Captain, but, uh, I can't accept.

1556
01:33:00,998 --> 01:33:02,916
-Boss?
-Bob?

1557
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,127
You're all better friends than I deserve.

1558
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:08,005
-Oh, well, that's true.
-[all laughing]

1559
01:33:08,088 --> 01:33:12,134
Especially you, Gerry.
And friends we will stay.

1560
01:33:12,801 --> 01:33:16,263
But as for where I live out
the rest of my days--

1561
01:33:17,431 --> 01:33:21,768
If I can, I'd like to spend them with Sam,
in her world.

1562
01:33:21,852 --> 01:33:22,853
[inhales sharply]

1563
01:33:25,564 --> 01:33:27,983
Be your forever family?

1564
01:33:29,818 --> 01:33:33,530
Me and you, a forever family?

1565
01:33:34,865 --> 01:33:36,116
I'd really love that.

1566
01:33:38,410 --> 01:33:39,995
[patrons] Aw.

1567
01:33:45,167 --> 01:33:47,836
You realize you're hugging me, right?

1568
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:51,131
Yes. And you better get used to it.

1569
01:33:51,215 --> 01:33:53,008
Juice drinks on the house!

1570
01:33:53,091 --> 01:33:54,468
[patrons cheering]

1571
01:33:56,136 --> 01:34:00,974
Yes, ma'am. Heat it up.
We're gonna call that the Lucky Dragon.

1572
01:34:07,314 --> 01:34:10,526
Mini palm tree. Some bulk beans.

1573
01:34:10,609 --> 01:34:12,027
Oh, I'm making bean bags,

1574
01:34:12,110 --> 01:34:15,113
and I thought a mix might be nice,
you know, in your hand.

1575
01:34:16,156 --> 01:34:21,370
And one soap-on-a-rope
brings your total to $13.57.

1576
01:34:21,453 --> 01:34:24,248
Let me just find my credit card.

1577
01:34:25,916 --> 01:34:28,252
-Oh, found my card!
-[gasps] Great.

1578
01:34:28,877 --> 01:34:30,420
Here you go, Ms. Charles.

1579
01:34:30,504 --> 01:34:31,505
Oh. [chuckles]

1580
01:34:31,588 --> 01:34:33,966
Hey, I got this,
Sam the manager. [chuckles]

1581
01:34:34,049 --> 01:34:35,175
Bless you, Marvin.

1582
01:34:36,593 --> 01:34:39,137
-Have a great time!
-See you Monday!

1583
01:34:39,221 --> 01:34:41,014
I should never
have gotten you a cell phone.

1584
01:34:41,098 --> 01:34:44,768
I can't stop. I'm sorry. I have a problem.
I was born to thumb-type.

1585
01:34:44,852 --> 01:34:47,145
Map says nine minutes,
but we'll take the shortcut.

1586
01:34:55,112 --> 01:34:56,530
[doorbell rings]

1587
01:34:56,613 --> 01:34:57,948
They're here!

1588
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:04,246
Sam!

1589
01:35:06,832 --> 01:35:09,918
-Come here, Bob.
-I say, Hazel. This is a tight one.

1590
01:35:10,002 --> 01:35:12,504
Hi, Sam. Hi, Bob.

1591
01:35:12,588 --> 01:35:14,131
[dog barks, pants]

1592
01:35:14,214 --> 01:35:15,716
Ah, ah. Sit.

1593
01:35:15,799 --> 01:35:18,302
Good work, Bingo. Who's your master?

1594
01:35:18,385 --> 01:35:23,891
Who's your master? That's right.
Bob is. Bob is your master.

1595
01:35:23,974 --> 01:35:24,975
[barks]

1596
01:35:25,058 --> 01:35:27,060
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

1597
01:35:28,061 --> 01:35:29,897
She's just a little excited.

1598
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:31,231
Yeah, me too.

1599
01:35:31,315 --> 01:35:33,609
Hazel's really lucky she found you guys.

1600
01:35:33,692 --> 01:35:35,652
I'm pretty sure we're the lucky ones.

1601
01:35:37,029 --> 01:35:40,532
Oh, and we'll see you here
for dinner on Sunday! Five o'clock.

1602
01:35:40,616 --> 01:35:42,284
We're having Bob's favorite.

1603
01:35:42,367 --> 01:35:43,410
We'll be here.

1604
01:35:43,493 --> 01:35:45,787
You hear that, Bob? Paninis on Sunday.

1605
01:35:45,871 --> 01:35:47,998
Tasty meat bread.

1606
01:35:48,081 --> 01:35:49,291
-Bingo.
-[Bingo barks]

1607
01:35:49,374 --> 01:35:50,375
Not you!

1608
01:35:55,464 --> 01:35:58,217
[Sam] My new life is nothing
like the one I pictured.

1609
01:35:59,092 --> 01:36:00,177
It's better.

1610
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:05,474
Things don't always go as planned,
of course.

1611
01:36:05,557 --> 01:36:08,560
Unless, well, you plan for them.

1612
01:36:17,486 --> 01:36:22,282
In the end, you might say that bad luck
led me to the luckiest thing in the world.

1613
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:24,785
Or was it good luck?

1614
01:36:25,369 --> 01:36:28,664
Whatever it was,
I found my forever family.

1615
01:36:29,373 --> 01:36:32,668
The kind that doesn't leave. They stick.

1616
01:36:32,751 --> 01:36:36,213
And I'd do it all over again to get here.
