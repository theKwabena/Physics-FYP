00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,250
On every inch of you, okay?

867
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:30,833
Be extremely careful.
Don't get it in your eyes.

868
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:32,083
And whatever you do,

869
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:34,291
don't get it in your butthole.

870
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:35,750
What happens in the butthole?

871
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:37,833
I mean, it can't kill you, but…

872
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,458
Jesus Christ.

873
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,416
By the way, lock your doors,
don't come out after dark, and, uh…

874
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:45,875
-Guess what?
-What?

875
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:47,041
You're dried up.

876
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,833
[sighs]

877
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,583
[typing]

878
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:28,708
Oh!

879
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:31,375
-[chuckles] Oh God. It's okay.
-I'm sorry about that.

880
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:32,833
-No, no, me. I got it.
-It's okay.

881
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:34,791
It's my fault.
I couldn't see over my baskets.

882
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:38,375
I got it. This is a… You a… you a doctor?

883
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:40,000
Uh, nurse, actually.

884
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:42,958
Hope you don't think this is weird,
but you got a lot of scrubs.

885
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:46,875
Yeah, I mean, I hate doing laundry,
so I kind of just kept buying new ones.

886
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:48,500
-Got out of control.
-Okay.

887
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:51,083
But, hey, new apartment.
Why not start off on the right foot?

888
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:55,208
Yeah. Well, welcome to the building.
I'm right there in 20.

889
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:59,000
-Oh! Well, I'm Heather. I'm in 19.
-Well, I'm Bud 20. [chuckles]

890
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:00,750
Can you help me with that, actually?

891
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:01,791
[Bud] Oh. Yeah.

892
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:03,291
-[Heather] Thanks.
-Yeah, no problem.

893
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,333
-You can just put that down anywhere.
-Sure. Okay.

894
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:11,166
-See you've got a retro vibe poppin', huh?
-Mm-hmm.

895
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,500
-Dig that.
-Thanks.

896
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:15,500
I wish I had a beer
or something to offer you.

897
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:19,666
Uh, a previous tenant left some ice cream
in the freezer, if you're interested.

898
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,416
No, thanks. I'll take a rain check.

899
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,583
-You sure?
-Yeah. Welcome to the building.

900
00:50:24,166 --> 00:50:25,166
Thank you.

901
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:49,166
Feeling better?

902
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:50,750
Not really.

903
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,833
Got a little bit of that
yellow stuff in my butthole.

904
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:56,375
It was so much worse
than what you even described.

905
00:50:56,458 --> 00:50:57,541
Bet it was.

906
00:50:58,166 --> 00:50:59,041
[Seth sighs]

907
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:05,166
You looking for something?

908
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,916
-Whoa. Hey, that's personal.
-No, no, no.

909
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,375
"Violation code 101, terminated vamps
and didn't report to the Union."

910
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:15,541
"Violation code 276, breaking and entering
without Union sanctions."

911
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:18,000
-That did happen.
-Violation. Violation. Violation.

912
00:51:18,083 --> 00:51:21,791
Oh, look at this. "Needs to reimburse me
for six-dollar muffin"?

913
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:23,416
It's a standard part of Union procedure.

914
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,125
-I have to document everything.
-It's not.

915
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:28,208
It's for Seeger to keep me out the Union.
Ain't that great?

916
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:29,958
You almost got me killed yesterday.

917
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:31,916
You almost got yourself killed yesterday.

918
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I told you stay your punk-ass in the car.
That's why I work by myself.

919
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:38,458
Listen. What? You're gonna die
in the name of kissing your boss's ass?

920
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:40,416
Well, he didn't give me a choice, okay?

921
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,416
Listen to me, Mr. Union Fellow.

922
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,583
I may not follow all the Union rules,
but let me tell you something.

923
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:48,375
If we went by the book,
we'd both be dead by now!

924
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,791
And you saw that yesterday.

925
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:03,541
Look. Just give me a couple of days.

926
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:08,000
Okay, a couple days.

927
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,333
So, what's on the agenda today?

928
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:15,541
Like every day.

929
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,125
Hunting vampires.

930
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:23,458
[tires squeal]

931
00:52:25,416 --> 00:52:27,625
[Seth] Bud, what are we
doing at a pawn shop?

932
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:31,083
[Bud] This dude's cheap as shit,
but he got goods we need in order to, uh…

933
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:32,625
What the hell?

934
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:34,708
[siren blaring]

935
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:40,875
Oh Jesus.

936
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,333
[whispers] Shut up. Shut up.

937
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:47,250
[Seth gagging]

938
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:48,166
Hey, hey.

939
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:51,958
Don't you puke in here!
Don't touch nothing. Don't leave your DNA.

940
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:53,125
I swallowed it.

941
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,916
[pop music playing softly on TV]

942
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,166
Troy.

943
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,083
Troy?

944
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:04,833
Damn it.

945
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,583
Wait, is that…

946
00:53:10,916 --> 00:53:11,916
It was.

947
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,875
[Seth] Oh no.

948
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,416
Who… who does that?

949
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:20,875
All right, we gotta move.

950
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:26,041
Wait a minute. Take this.

951
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:27,000
Ow!

952
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:28,666
Are you kidding me?

953
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,625
-It's not right, okay. Wait--
-Damn right. How you think he feels, huh?

954
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:32,666
Come on, let's go.

955
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,833
Wait. You can't leave.
That's against protocol.

956
00:53:34,916 --> 00:53:36,750
We have to call the Union
and wait for them.

957
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:39,833
-Code 233 says any hunter who encounters…
-Code? I don't give a shit.

958
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:42,708
…suspicious civilian death
will be under a 30-day suspension--

959
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:44,541
We don't have 30 days. I don't give fuck!

960
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:46,875
We gotta leave.
There's other vamps around here. Let's go.

961
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:48,916
No, no. I'm calling.

962
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:51,833
Whoa! We have dead humans here.
We have to report this.

963
00:53:51,916 --> 00:53:54,250
That ain't no dead human!
That's my friend!

964
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:57,666
Listen, I'm not telling you
you cannot report it.

965
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,583
I'm just telling you to delay it.

966
00:53:59,666 --> 00:54:02,291
We'll make an anonymous call to the cops,
and, after 24 hours,

967
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:04,291
you can make
your funky little report. Let's go!

968
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:06,708
Why do you care?
What difference does a day make?

969
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:09,333
I'm gonna lose my family in a day!
That's the difference!

970
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:10,375
What?

971
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:14,708
Look, if I don't score some prices
at Union wages by Monday,

972
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:16,625
my wife and my daughter move to Florida.

973
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:20,583
That means, if you call Seeger,
I'm gonna lose my family.

974
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:25,458
I'm… I'm sorry.

975
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:26,708
Yeah, I bet you are.

976
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:32,666
So what you're saying
is you… you kinda need me.

977
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:33,583
But…

978
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:36,458
No, I didn't… I didn't say I need you.
I didn't say that.

979
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:38,250
-No, I just mean…
-I didn't say that.

980
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:41,083
You told me your secrets.
I'm gonna break protocol for you.

981
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:43,625
-So we're like a team, partners, whatever.
-I didn't say partners.

982
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:45,041
-Crockett and Tubbs.
-No.

983
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:47,458
-Any partnership you find satisfactory.
-Listen.

984
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:49,166
What I'm saying is this,

985
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:52,500
is as a man,
just give me till the weekend.

986
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:56,708
Yeah, okay. Until the weekend.

987
00:54:57,875 --> 00:54:58,875
Yeah.

988
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:07,291
[Heather] Look. What do you want me to do?
If I keep… he's gonna suspect something.

989
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:08,958
Just relax.

990
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:34,666
[vehicle approaching]

991
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:41,416
[Bud] I got a tip on this house
from Big J.

992
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:44,541
Why don't you
check the glove box right now?

993
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:47,708
Yeah.

994
00:55:47,791 --> 00:55:49,916
That's what we're doing right there.

995
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,166
That's what we doing.

996
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:53,208
These… garlic grenades.

997
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:56,000
Pull the pin, garlic and sawdust
comes out, clears the room.

998
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:58,875
I think. Haven't actually had to use it.

999
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:01,083
But, in theory,
that's what's gonna happen.

1000
00:56:01,666 --> 00:56:03,875
An unproven weapon
for my first real vampire fight.

1001
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:05,541
-That's wonderful. Thank you.
-Shit. Shit!

1002
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:06,625
What? What?

1003
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:08,125
Goddamn Nazarian Brothers.

1004
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:12,000
Wait, the Nazarian brothers.
Oh, they're big-time hunters.

1005
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:13,833
Yeah, not bigger than me though.

1006
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,333
They cleared out all of Glendale.
Now they're headed west.

1007
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:21,416
[techno music playing]

1008
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,458
-Hey, Bud.
-[music stops]

1009
00:56:23,541 --> 00:56:25,000
I thought I smelled chlorine.

1010
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:27,791
[sniffing] Funny. Thought I smelled shit.

1011
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:31,000
-Who's the cupcake?
-[Seth] Seth.

1012
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:34,708
I'm his Union rep. But you can
call me Cupcake or whatever you prefer.

1013
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:37,541
-I'm a big fan, by the way.
-Want to get a selfie for your Instagram?

1014
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:41,083
What you guys doing in Simi Valley?

1015
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:42,916
You know what we're doing here, bro.

1016
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,875
We let you do the hard part for us,

1017
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:47,583
figure out which house
is hiding the goods, then, you know.

1018
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:50,125
You got me twisted.
I did the work, but I ain't do it for you.

1019
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:52,083
Oh, come on, Bud. Think about it.

1020
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:56,208
Waste a week waiting for the right moment
that we just might take from you?

1021
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:58,083
Or we run up there in force right now.

1022
00:56:58,166 --> 00:57:00,666
Sack the place together.
Split the money down the middle.

1023
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,541
Well, one, ain't nobody
taking shit from me.

1024
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:05,791
And two…

1025
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:14,625
Yeah. It's a good idea.

1026
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:18,625
-[techno music resumes]
-Wanna get a selfie?

1027
00:57:19,125 --> 00:57:21,375
Right now? Is that appropriate?

1028
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:23,500
-We can wait--
-That's not appropriate at all.

1029
00:57:24,916 --> 00:57:27,333
-What's this?
-Keep your neck from getting chewed out.

1030
00:57:28,541 --> 00:57:30,958
Take this. Stay behind me.
I keep you alive.

1031
00:57:31,041 --> 00:57:33,583
Don't shoot where they are.

01:16:06,708 --> 01:16:08,458
[Audrey] First, I'm gonna turn her,

1372
01:16:08,541 --> 01:16:11,583
and then I'm gonna watch
as she drinks your wife.

1373
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:15,083
[sighs] I wish
you could be there to see it,

1374
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:17,875
but I'm afraid
someone's having you for dinner.

[gasping]

1384
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:52,666
Oh, Bud.

1385
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:54,416
Oh!

1386
01:16:54,916 --> 01:16:56,375
Oh, I feel weird.

1387
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:58,208
Yeah, I bet… I bet you do.

1388
01:16:58,291 --> 01:16:59,708
What happened to me?

1389
01:16:59,791 --> 01:17:02,916
Just some bullshit. You know how shit go.

1390
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,125
But, uh…

1391
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:07,416
-[groans]
-You probably wanna… check your teeth.

1392
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,583
Check my teeth?

1393
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:11,041
Yeah, just check them.
There's a mirror over there.

1394
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:12,125
Oh…

1395
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,583
Oh! Oh no!

1396
01:17:15,666 --> 01:17:16,791
[gasps]

1397
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,750
Oh no. Oh, that's not good.

1398
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:19,750
[hisses]

1399
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:23,208
-What! That was totally involuntary.
-It's like a hiccup, probably.

1400
01:17:23,291 --> 01:17:26,458
-[gasps]
-I'm sorry, man, it was all my fault.

1401
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:27,541
How you feel?

1402
01:17:28,166 --> 01:17:30,791
Pretty horrified
about the fact that I'm a vampire.

1403
01:17:30,875 --> 01:17:32,625
-Right. Right.
-But also like…

1404
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:34,708
-I don't know, kind of amazing.
-Yeah, like--

1405
01:17:34,791 --> 01:17:37,541
Like my blood, it just…
it feels like it's on fire--

1406
01:17:37,625 --> 01:17:39,916
Like you had, like,
a lot of energy drinks.

1407
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,083
[sniffs] Oh, I can smell everything!

1408

[sniffs]

1409
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:46,083
Oh God, did I shit myself this time?

1410
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:47,500
No, no, no, you look fine.

1411
01:17:47,583 --> 01:17:49,541
-Is there like a mark?
-No, you look good.

1412
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:50,958
Everything looks great.

1413
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,791
Listen, let's just take it easy.

1414
01:17:52,875 --> 01:17:54,875
-We're gonna work this out.
-[stomach rumbling]

1415
01:17:54,958 --> 01:17:56,041
Oh wow.

1416
01:17:56,125 --> 01:17:57,250
Mainly I just…

1417
01:17:57,958 --> 01:17:59,208
Whoa, I just feel

1418
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:00,583
hungry!

1419
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:02,875
[snarls]

1420
01:18:05,666 --> 01:18:07,416
Goddamn it, Seth.

01:18:08,208 --> 01:18:09,125
[sighs]

1422
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:11,541
I'm sorry, kid.

1423
01:18:11,625 --> 01:18:13,708
I'm actually gonna miss you, man,
you know?

1424
01:18:13,791 --> 01:18:16,041
It's crazy how
you get attached to someone.

1425
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:17,208
Oh shit.

1426
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:21,166
Bud?

01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:22,708
Huh?

1428
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:25,750
You cut my head off.
I thought we were friends.

1429
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:27,958
I… You rushed me.

1430
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:30,541
It's just reaction. That's what I do.

1431
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:34,291
It's in my blood. It's like…
You ever see Tyson? He…

1432
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,833
You don't walk up on Tyson either.

1433
01:18:37,375 --> 01:18:39,000
Friendship is complicated, huh?

1434
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:40,333
[wheezing]

1435
01:18:40,416 --> 01:18:42,916
Yeah, friendships are complicated.

1436
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,208
All right, wait. Follow my voice.
Left, there. Yep, okay.

1437
01:18:46,291 --> 01:18:48,458
Easy. No. Okay, easy, easy.

1438
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:51,083
[groaning] Okay, here we go.

1439
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:52,166

1440
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:53,916
Okay, gentle.

1441
01:18:54,916 --> 01:18:56,083
Gentle. [exhales]

1443
01:18:58,375 --> 01:18:59,708
Huh. Still fits.

1444
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:02,083
Wha…

[groans]

1446
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:07,333
Oh, it's been quite the week.

1447
01:19:07,416 --> 01:19:09,666
Yeah, it has. You good?

1448
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:10,625
[chuckles]

1449
01:19:10,708 --> 01:19:12,375
-How do I look?
-You look all right.

1450
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:14,041
-You feel all right?
-You swear?

1451
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:16,083
-Yeah.

-Hey!
-Sorry. Just kidding.

1453
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:19,458
-Okay. All right.
-Too soon. Too soon. All right.

1454
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:23,666
Hey, I'm sorry I tried to eat you.

1455
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:25,916
How 'bout we not report this
to Seeger until Monday?

1456
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,625
Seeger, shit. Oh, what?
You don't think he's gonna notice?

1457
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:33,083
What, am I just supposed to
wear turtlenecks from now on?

1458
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:37,000
I mean, I do look good in a T-neck,
but that's not sustainable.

1459
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:40,916
-Wait. Where are we going?
-Going to get my family back.

1460
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,333
I have to stop at my place
and get some information.

1461
01:19:43,875 --> 01:19:46,583
What's going on with your neck?
Is it repairing itself?

1462
01:19:47,375 --> 01:19:48,708
I actually think it is.

1463
01:19:48,791 --> 01:19:50,916
Okay, just be careful.
Don't go over any speed bumps.

1464
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,000
Damn. Damn.

1465
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:56,750
My bad.

1466
01:20:02,875 --> 01:20:05,375
[Seth] You have a driving problem.
You know that, right?

1467
01:20:05,458 --> 01:20:07,166
I gotta go to apartment 19.

1468
01:20:07,958 --> 01:20:09,041
I'll be back in five.

Heather, you just moved in.
Leaving so soon?

01:20:18,791 --> 01:20:20,875
Bud, just listen to me.

1473

Look, we need to talk.

1474
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:26,958
Talk? Vampires kidnapped my family.
You wanna talk?

Let me at least explain.

You think I wanna
work for a monster like her?

1492
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:10,583

Look, she forced me to get close to you.

1497
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:22,250
She wanted to get back at you

What you talking about?

1499

She just…
She just wanted to know how to hurt you.

Why?

light your finger on fire, huh?

[blows]

1504
01:21:44,416 --> 01:21:46,291
You killed a vampire Monday, didn't you?

1505

-Sweet old lady?
-Not so sweet, actually.

1506

Daughter? How?

1508
01:21:54,791 --> 01:21:57,750
When she came over, she had
a little girl she had to leave behind.

1509
01:21:57,833 --> 01:22:01,458
So by the time they went back,
found her, and turned her, she was old.

Holy shit.

1516
01:22:23,208 --> 01:22:26,666
You're walking on sacred ground.
You should be honored.

Where are you taking us?

1518
01:22:28,875 --> 01:22:31,375
-Why, are you frightened?
-No.

1519
01:22:31,458 --> 01:22:32,291
You should be.

1520
01:22:32,375 --> 01:22:34,625
Well, then you don't know me
that well, bitch. Ah!

1521
01:22:36,625 --> 01:22:38,166
Why are you doing this?

1522
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:39,541
Paige, don't talk to her.

1523
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:40,916
She has a right to know.

1524
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:43,916
You don't get to decide-- [gasps]

1525
01:22:46,916 --> 01:22:49,916
I had a daughter once, feisty like you.

1526
01:22:50,583 --> 01:22:52,458
I wanted to make a better world for her.

1527
01:22:52,541 --> 01:22:55,375
A world where
she could be free from hiding.

1528
01:22:56,083 --> 01:22:58,375
But your father took that away from me.

1529
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:01,708
Now, you see,
it's only fair I take you away from him.

no one can ever hurt her again.

1724
01:34:07,916 --> 01:34:11,916
I'm not supposed to kill you yet,
but you've been a real pain in the ass,

1725
01:34:12,583 --> 01:34:13,875
so give me one good reason.

1726
01:34:13,958 --> 01:34:14,916
Burn in hell.

1727
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,125
Good enough.

-No, I planned it like that.

1733
01:34:37,458 --> 01:34:38,583

All right. I'll let you go.

What do you think, muñeca?

1753
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:36,833
I'm gonna kill your daddy,

1754
01:35:36,916 --> 01:35:39,208
then I'm gonna make you
drink your mean old mommy,

1755
01:35:39,291 --> 01:35:42,958
and then I'm gonna be
your new, improved mommy.

-Get out.
-Vampires don't pee or poop.

-Please let me have this little victory.
-Of course you can. C'mon. Let's go.

1825

I'll miss you, baby.

1830
01:40:13,333 --> 01:40:14,166
Oh, no.

1831
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:15,375
Go ahead. Come on.

1832
01:40:16,083 --> 01:40:17,708
It's got good energy in that.

1833
01:40:21,166 --> 01:40:22,000
All right.

1834
01:40:22,916 --> 01:40:25,458
We were hiding right over there.
Right over there.

1835
01:40:25,541 --> 01:40:26,875
Jablonski!

1836
01:40:27,833 --> 01:40:30,791
Seeger? What the hell you doing,
walking all fast like that?

1837
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:32,916
New shoe boots on.

1838
01:40:33,708 --> 01:40:36,791
And you. What are you, sick?

1839
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,416
-Uh, pink eye.
-What?

1840
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,416
It's when poo particles get in your eye.

1841
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:43,583
Where's Big John?

1842
01:40:44,333 --> 01:40:45,333
[sighs]

1843
01:40:47,125 --> 01:40:49,500
Oh goddamn it!

1844
01:40:50,916 --> 01:40:51,958
I did you a solid.

1845
01:40:52,041 --> 01:40:55,916
But now you have
graciously returned the favor

1846
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,416
because after the shit
you pulled here tonight,

1847
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:00,625
I'll never have to deal with you again.

1848
01:41:01,416 --> 01:41:02,958
For starters,

1849
01:41:03,041 --> 01:41:07,583
flagrantly violating code 682,
operating outside of your shift.

1850
01:41:07,666 --> 01:41:09,041
Actually, sir, if I may.

1851
01:41:09,791 --> 01:41:12,916
Code 741 states that,
"If a hunter is in a 911 situation,

1852
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,875
he may circumvent normal operating hours

1853
01:41:14,958 --> 01:41:17,833
so long as he notifies the Union
before entering," which he did.

1854
01:41:17,916 --> 01:41:19,875
Thank you. Thank you for that.

1855
01:41:19,958 --> 01:41:23,625
There's also code 584,
unlawful termination of familiars

1856
01:41:23,708 --> 01:41:25,583
without prior authorization.

1857
01:41:25,666 --> 01:41:28,375
Yes, sir, that is correct,
but Section 4 states,

1858
01:41:28,458 --> 01:41:31,208
"When fired on, a hunter is
lawfully allowed to return fire,"

1859
01:41:31,291 --> 01:41:32,625
which is what happened here.

1860
01:41:33,375 --> 01:41:37,333
Code 424, "A Union hunter
must make all reasonable efforts

1861
01:41:37,416 --> 01:41:41,375
to limit collateral damage to property
while engaging in a hunt."

1862
01:41:41,458 --> 01:41:42,333
Boom!

1863
01:41:42,416 --> 01:41:44,416
-Sir, code 42--
-I got this.

1864
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:49,166
Code 424 was rescinded by
the national office in January.

1865
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:51,208
Boom. Boom.

1866
01:41:51,291 --> 01:41:53,708
-Someone's been reading.
-Saw it in the newsletter.

1867
01:41:53,791 --> 01:41:55,916
Yeah. I see what's going on here.

1868
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:56,833
Uh-huh.

1869
01:41:57,375 --> 01:41:58,333
Loopholes.

1870
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:01,458
Think you're smarter than me?

1871
01:42:01,958 --> 01:42:04,875
Then you can probably spell "traitor."

1872
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:06,833
Sure.

1873
01:42:06,916 --> 01:42:09,666
T-R-A-I-T-O-R. What was the point of that?

1874
01:42:13,708 --> 01:42:15,916
Carol's keeping her fucking desk.

1875
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,916
Good! She can have it.

1876
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,125
I'm a field man now!
Mowing down vamps with my best friend Bud.

1877
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:23,375
[Bud chuckles]

1878
01:42:25,125 --> 01:42:27,833
-That felt good. [laughs]
-You did that.

1879
01:42:27,916 --> 01:42:30,125
Wait. Shit. What are you
gonna do about the money?

1880
01:42:30,208 --> 01:42:32,000
-Oh, I'm good.
-[rattles]

1881
01:42:32,083 --> 01:42:33,750
Think I'm gonna be all right.

1882
01:42:33,833 --> 01:42:34,666
And, uh…

1883
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,083
fuck Carol.

1884
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:39,708
Hey, should I drink Carol?

1885
01:42:39,791 --> 01:42:41,291
No, no, that's a lot of cholesterol.

1886
01:42:41,375 --> 01:42:42,333
Right, okay.

1887
01:42:42,416 --> 01:42:45,041
I won't go out of my way,
but if, like, there's a chance encounter

1888
01:42:45,125 --> 01:42:46,500
